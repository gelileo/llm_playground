Code § 11.31a) or a private tutoring program ( 22 Pa. Code § 11.31(b)(1)) is a right; school district permission is not needed to commence either program, as long as the required documentation is submitted. More information about home education and private tutoring programs can be found on the Pennsylvania Department of Education's Home Education and Private Tutoring website. Extracurricular Participation by Home Education Students Home education programs (also known as homeschooling) are programs where the education of the student is directed by the parent or guardian or such person having legal custody of the child or children. The supervisor of the home education program must have a high school diploma or its equivalent. All adults living in the home and persons having legal custody of a child or children must not have been convicted of the criminal offenses itemized in 24 Pa. Code § 1-111(e). The notarized affidavit and objectives, and immunization records must be submitted to Derry Township School District, Administrative Office for the Home Education Program to begin. This affidavit should be submitted by August 1st of each year (24 Pa. Code § 13-1327.1(b)(1)).  Without this documentation, the home education program would not be authorized. An appropriate education is defined as “a program consisting of instruction in the required subjects for the time required in this act and in which the student demonstrates sustained progress in the overall program.” The portfolio evaluation certifies whether an appropriate education occurred. What: A written evaluation by a qualified evaluator must be submitted for each student. See the Home Education Evaluators section regarding a qualified evaluator. Who: The evaluation must be submitted by the home education supervisor to the DTSD District Office When: The evaluation must be submitted by June 30th of each year.",489

Our goal is to be a national model for public education. That includes demonstrating exemplary fiscal management. The district’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. The district begins developing the budget for the subsequent fiscal year in late summer and the process concludes in June when the board adopts the final budget. Over these months, district and building administrators internally review existing and proposed educational programs that will drive the district forward in meeting the educational needs of its students. The board’s finance committee holds several meetings from September through May/June to discuss the budget and solicit input from the public. At its June 12, 2023 business meeting, the DTSD Board of School Directors voted to adopt the budget for the 2023-2024 school year. 30 E.",493

45,"The state-mandated that students be screened for body mass index (BMI).  Every year, your child will have his/her height and weight measured as part of the state mandated health screening for all enrolled students.  Based on these measurements, a BMI will be calculated. BMI (Body Mass Index) is a number used roughly to estimate body fat composition, based on a person’s height and weight.  It is used to help identify anyone who may be underweight or overweight. BMI = Weight in pounds  (divided by) height in inches (divided by) height in inches X 703 For children, BMI is compared with other children of the same sex and age in growth charts.  It is more important to watch how your child grows over time, than to look at any one point on the chart.  A smooth growth curve over time would reflect healthy growth for most children. BMI alone will not tell you if your child has too much or too little body fat.  Some children have high BMI because they have heavy muscles or bones.  Your child’s doctor can do a complete evaluation including overall health, diet, and activity/exercise.  BMI should be considered a screening tool and not a definitive measure of overweight and obesity.  The indicator does have limitations.  For example, athletes, dancers, and other physically active students may have a high BMI due to increased muscle mass, which weighs more than fat mass. We look at your child’s BMI to help prevent health problems now that could impact the child as he/ she gets older.  The nation has seen a large increase in overweight children and, consequently, overweight adults.  Being overweight can cause such health problems as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 Diabetes, asthma, sleep apnea, and psychosocial problems such as low self-esteem, depression, and high-risk behaviors. If your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, it would be especially wise to start making changes now in your child’s health habits.  Paying attention to the types of foods eaten, portion sizes, and physical activity is a good start for better health now and in the future! Every school district annually submits aggregate information from their growth screening data to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. 30 E.",465

56,"If your child is demonstrating excessive crying or a change in crying frequency…Try these strategies: Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. Avoid phrases like, “boys shouldn’t cry” or, “big kids don’t cry” Remind them of  other times when the child has overcome obstacles Describe how a familiar movie,  television or book characters handled their emotions. Attention or rumination often reinforces crying behavior When the child is crying set a timer for how long you will indulge the topic causing the tears Provide a safe place for the child to cry without an audience Emphasize that emotions will come and go. Talk about the visual of emotions acting as waves on a beach, it will wash in and wash out. Label the issue at hand, identify sensations they are feeling in their body due to the issue, identify what they need to do to feel better immediately (e.g., nap, take a walk), and brainstorm what they can do to calm when they feel this way. For example, If your child is sleeping irregularly or has difficulty sleeping…Try these strategies: Go to bed/wake up at the same time each day (set an alarm to help) Do not use your bed for anything other than sleeping If possible, complete school work outside the bedroom setting If unable to fall asleep after ~30 mins, get out of bed and engage in a calm alternative activity until sleepy (e.g. reading a book, meditating) then try again. If your child appears to be displaying behaviors that are related to anger, such as screaming, crying, and/or physical aggression…Try these strategies: Once the child is calm, encourage them to talk about and problem solve more effective ways to get what they want “You were really angry/upset, and I want to understand why.” When you do speak, make sure your voice is neutral, calm, quiet “Let’s go calm down” (or another phrase that reminds them to utilize their calm down area) As parents we can show our children what calm behavior looks like by remaining in control of our own emotions/action Use self-talk (“share my calm, don’t joint the chaos”; “they are having a hard time, not giving me a hard time”) Use a grounding technique (e.g.",489
57,"stress ball, take a sip of cold water) Once your child calms down, praise appropriate behavior (e.g. “I love how you and your brother are sharing your toys”) You can also encourage appropriate behavior by creating a way for your child to earn some of their favorite toys/activities Have the child earn points/stickers to earn something they really enjoy (e.g. 10 stickers = 20 minutes of video games) Break down tasks into simple one-step directions (“first put on your shoes”) Use “When/Then” statements (“When you finish schoolwork, then you can watch TV”) Provide frequent reminders of those expectations and rules (Visual cues for younger children) “Hitting is not okay, you need to spend some time by yourself and calm down.” Younger children may benefit from a timeout or spending time in a calm down area “You cannot hit your brother when you are mad. When you are quiet and calm for 2 minutes, you can come back and play with your brother” Older children should go to their room/calm area to calm down If they hurt someone, after they are calm, they should be encouraged to apologize/repair the relationship Discipline should teach your child what to do instead (“use your words” vs. “don’t hit”) During this crisis, some children may lose the ability to feel joy. The things that once made them happy are no longer fun or enjoyable. If your child no longer shows interest in activities he or she once enjoyed…Try these strategies: Engage in social interactions through platforms such as Zoom, FaceTime, and Skype with his or her friends or other family members outside the home Help your child keep a consistent sleep schedule with predictable times to wake up and go to bed, which is important to maintaining a positive mood. This schedule does not necessarily need to reflect the child’s pre-COVID-19 schedule, but should still contain consistency. A healthy diet and time for physical activities such as going for a walk or bike ride can also be helpful in boosting your child’s positive mood. Participate in a home exercise with your child to help boost his or her mood, spend time together, and potentially elicit a few giggles! She or he may share about missing out on particularly fun experiences associated with the end of school/beginning of summer. Give your child room to share his or her feelings and listen without judgment or without reassuring that everything will be fine and that you understand that they are disappointed.",501
58,"It’s ok to tell them that you are disappointed as well. Encourage your child to participate in relaxation techniques to improve his or her ability to cope. Journaling his or her thoughts and experiences during this time, as journaling is a useful coping skill and will allow the child to look back on when we participated in social distancing Progressive muscle relaxation, which is the tensing and releasing of muscle groups in order, can be helpful in soothing the nervous system. Look for a hobby that is calming to you, but could also be of interest to your child This could be cooking or baking a certain (family) recipe, chalk painting/redoing old furniture, knitting/sewing/crocheting, painting, starting a garden/planting flowers, etc. Validate how difficult these times are for your child and how difficult it is to participate in social distancing and distance learning. Hearing this validation from a parent can help calm a child’s frustration. For teenagers in particular, help them recognize they do still have a future and that this difficult time will not last forever. Encourage your child to continue to think about the future by researching college choices or teams or clubs they may wish to join once school resumes. Model the suggestions listed above, possibly expressing your own worries and how you are choosing to cope. If your child is refusing to do school work…Try these strategies: Demonstrate an authoritative approach to parenting by being both responsive and demanding. In demonstrating responsiveness, you convey warmth, caring, and respect as you respond to your child's emotional, social, and academic needs. Establishing clear behavioral and academic expectations and routines (such as completing homework), having fair rules and consequences, and closely monitoring engagement-related behavior. Praise and reward your child for good behavior, but especially for behavior related to student engagement, such as completing assignments. (“I really like how hard you have been working.”) Using rewards wisely and strategically also means that you are not harming your child's internal motivation. Closely monitor and assist with homework assignments, as appropriate. Provide a set time and appropriate place for completing homework, have clear expectations, and check to make sure all assignments are completed and on time. When your child has options to choose from, guide your child to choose materials and activities that match their interests, values, and goals. When choices are not an option, try to point out the value of learning the new skill—even if the skill does not relate directly to the child's interests and future goals.",500
59,"Challenge your child to set short-term and long- term goals and to develop plans for achieving them. Goals should be realistic and geared toward both academics and behavior. Ask them to think about what one or two things they can get done today If your child is demonstrating signs of fear, worry or anxiety …Try these strategies: “You look upset to me. Can you tell me how you are feeling?” Ask them open questions (e.g. what, how, why) to describe their feelings. You can tell them that it is natural to be worried or nervous at times. Let them know that there are times that you are also worried and anxious. You can then tell them how you handle stress and serve as a role model for them in coping with challenges associated with COVID. Tell your child it is natural to be worried or afraid at times. Make sure to correct misinformation as children often imagine situations that are worse than reality. “I know you are nervous about the virus, but there are things we can do to keep from getting sick. Let’s practice those things together” Teach your child relaxation strategies, such as deep breathing or belly breathing. Act as a role model, showing them how you handle strong emotions. Be honest and accurate about social distancing and why routines are changing, but focus on the positive (e.g., “Isn’t it great that we have more time to spend together!”). Empathize with your child’s feelings but do not reinforce fears Celebrate having more time as a family - do family projects and make it as fun as possible. Allow older children to connect with their friends virtually. Encourage positive actions, such as writing a caring letter to a family member or friend. Remind your children that you are available to them, that you care about them, and that they can talk to you anytime. If your child is refusing to do school work…Try these strategies: Provide your children with an interesting schedule (predictability) Wake time, bed times, meal times, and scheduled screen time should be kept as consistent as possible Include scheduled breaks, times for fun/ reinforcing activities, particularly after children are asked to complete chores or practice school-related tasks Make sure activities and expectations are specific/well-defined For example, “after waking up, you will get dressed, come downstairs for breakfast, and then brush your teeth” Create a visual reminder of the daily schedule for young kids who cannot read Break down large tasks into smaller tasks (e.g.",498

Athletics also teach participants lessons in teamwork, discipline, leadership, and overcoming adversity. As such, the District offers an array of athletic programs for high school and middle school students. The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) and the Mid Penn Conference (MPC) govern Derry Township School District’s athletic programs. The PIAA is responsible for the overall organization, development, and direction of the interscholastic athletic programs of Pennsylvania while the MPC, which is comprised of 31 central Pennsylvania school districts, is responsible for fostering, developing, and promoting athletic relationships between member schools. Mr. Montedoro started his career in High School Athletics in 1989 and hasn't looked back since.",485

The district encourages all constituents - parents and guardians, community members, and local businesses - to communicate with us regarding district operations. Anonymous submissions or those made under a pseudonym cannot be addressed. When a question or concern occurs, the first step is to communicate at the local school or department level. If you would like to ask a question or share a concern about your child, speak to your child's teacher first. (Inquiries initially directed to administrators or school board members will be referred to the local level.) Search our Online Staff Directory to find direct contact information for staff. Making direct contact with the appropriate staff member typically ensures the fastest response. For more information about who to contact for your specific question or concern please visit our chain of command matrix here. Copies of Community Correspondence forms submitted via this mechanism are also automatically shared with school board members and top administrators for review so they can staff informed about what is on the minds of constituents.",491

162,"We have adopted a Comprehensive plan that raises the bar for student achievement within a safe learning environment and prepares each and every child to be successful as global citizens in the 21st Century. In doing this, it is imperative that any barriers to student learning also be addressed. Professional school counselors are certified educators with a minimum of a master’s degree in school counseling.  School counselors are uniquely qualified to address all students’ academic, personal/social, and career development needs by designing, implementing, evaluating, and enhancing a comprehensive school counseling program that promotes and enhances student success. ECC & Elementary School Counseling OfficeMiddle School Counseling OfficeHigh School Counseling Office Derry Township’s school psychologists and masters/doctoral level school psychology interns help children and youth succeed academically, socially, and emotionally. They collaborate with administrators, educators, parents, and other professionals to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments for all students that strengthen connections between home and school. The Derry Township School Nurses believe that the health of a child has a direct effect on his/ her ability to fully access his/ her educational opportunities. Safe2Say Something is an easy and confidential way to report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies. The tip line is operated and monitored 24/7 by the Office of the Attorney General where tips are reviewed, classified, and forwarded to the appropriate school district. Tips that are found to contain information that may indicate a ""life safety"" issue are prioritized and immediately forwarded to the appropriate county emergency dispatch center. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Student Assistance Program (SAP), is overseen by the PA Network for Student Assistance Services (PNSAS) Interagency and Regional Coordinators’ team; comprised of representation from the PA Departments of Education (Safe Schools Office), Drug and Alcohol Programs (Division of Prevention and Intervention) and Human Services (Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services). The Pennsylvania Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a systematic team process used to mobilize school resources to remove barriers to learning. SAP is designed to assist school personnel in identifying issues including alcohol, tobacco, other drugs, mental health, and other issues which pose a barrier to a student’s success.",444
163,"Developed by the Committee for Children www.cfchildren.org Second Step is a program rooted in social-emotional learning (SEL) that helps transform schools into supportive, successful learning environments uniquely equipped to encourage children to thrive.This curriculum is implemented in grades K-5 In an effort to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for all students, Derry Township School District believes bullying is an unacceptable behavior that adults and students have a responsibility to stop. The District recognizes that bullying creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, detracts from the safe environment necessary for student learning, and may lead to more serious violence. Therefore, the District prohibits bullying of any kind. The Pennsylvania Department of Education’s Office for Safe Schools has implemented the PA Bullying Prevention Consultation Line. The Bullying Prevention Consultation Line is a toll-free number to allow individuals experiencing chronic and unresolved bullying to discuss effective strategies and available resources to deal with school-based bullying. This supportive resource has been developed in collaboration with the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (CHPDP), and is available at no cost to students, parents/guardians, and school districts across the state. Users can leave a message 24 hour a day, seven days a week, and will be returned Monday-Friday during normal business hours. The Consultation Line number is 1-866-716-0424.

The goal of the program is to provide students with the language skills needed to actively participate in social and academic settings. Support and intensive instruction are provided to enable students to become successful in content classes. ESL instruction correlates to the English Language Proficiency Standards outlined by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Emphasis is placed on the four domains of communication: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. These domains are addressed through Content Based Instruction in an ESL class. Modifications and accommodations are also made in content classes based on an individual student’s level of English proficiency. Completion of the ESL program is based on the exit criteria set forth by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Family and Consumer Sciences standards were passed into law, January, 2003. Family and Consumer Science studies the relationship between individuals, families, and communities and the environment in which they live. It recognizes the importance positive human relationships, good nutrition, and a balanced lifestyle play in the ability of students to come to school ready to learn and to enter the ‘adult’ world ready to fulfill their role as productive citizens and raise strong families. Family and consumer sciences curriculum supports the knowledge and skills that students need as family members both now and in the future.",488
224,"In addition, it requires all students to investigate and plan for possible careers, develop practical skills for employment, develop financial literacy, manage resources, and practice positive communication skills. Our goal is to take increased responsibility for improving their quality of living and develop the knowledge and skills needed in making choices to meet their personal, family and work responsibilities. FCS speaks to the challenges we face as members of a global society and is delivered in an authentic manner. It lends itself to integration and collaboration with other disciplines. The rigorous curriculum is designed to be authentic, stress teamwork, leadership, and technology. It applies math, science, and communication skills to everyday living. In the middle school, all students will take FCS in 7th & 8th grade. •    Interpersonal Communication & Conflict Resolution •    Personal & Family Finance & Resource Management All FCS courses at the high school are electives and one semester in length.

The Derry Township School District’s library curriculum is designed to empower students to accomplish the following: consume information critically, enhance their love of literature and reading, research skillfully, and use information ethically and productively.  With heightened demands for critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration, our learners must develop relevant skills to succeed in our information-rich society.  All learners must be able to access high-quality information from diverse perspectives, make sense of it to draw their own conclusions or create new knowledge, and share their knowledge with others.",415
225,"The curriculum framework is standards-based and built upon the Model Curriculum for Pennsylvania School Library Programs, which draws on the PA Core Standards, the American Association of School Librarian’s Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, and ISTE Standards.  It is designed to vertically articulate information literacy across the grades from kindergarten through grade twelve.  The focus is on a sequential and broad set of information and technology skills and performance standards that are necessary for academic achievement. At the elementary level, students have a regularly scheduled library class. At the secondary level, skills are embedded in curricular objectives from various disciplines since a collaborative approach to teaching the standards is most effective in the context of content learning. Hershey High School provides a standards-aligned approach to mathematics that emphasizes higher-order thinking and exposure to authentic, real-world content. Throughout the program, students are given opportunities to investigate, hypothesize and discover mathematical phenomena. Though most students complete four years of mathematics at the high school level, students must complete a minimum of three courses. Our core mathematics courses lead to Advanced Placement Courses in Calculus and then to Advanced Calculus. Our elective courses include Statistics and Advanced Placement Statistics as well as a trio of programming courses including Advanced Placement Computer Science. Our school district mission statement asks that we have an education system that engages all students every day to help them achieve their greatest potential as global citizens. This is the goal of the Derry Township and Hershey Middle School mathematics programs. Our program was designed around two central themes: to provide a curriculum centered around Pennsylvania Common Core standards as well as allowing students to maximize individual potential. The curriculum used is based on the College Preparatory Math program also known as CPM. Students begin in sixth grade taking one of two courses: either CC1 or an accelerated course, called CC1.5, that covers one and a half years of curriculum in a one-year setting. Several metrics are used to determine the placement of students in seventh grade. Students are enrolled either in CC2, CC2.5, or CC Algebra. Based upon satisfactory completion of courses in seventh grade, students may be enrolled in CC3, CC Algebra or CC Geometry in the eighth grade. All three years of courses focus on developmentally appropriate progressions through statistics, probability, algebraic concepts, geometry, measurement and numeric operations. This is done in a setting where problem-solving and logical thinking is central to instruction.",486
226,"The focus of all middle school courses is in line with what Pennsylvania Common Core states: that is to have ""middle school standards call on students to practice applying mathematical ways of thinking to real-world issues and challenges. They prepare students to think and reason mathematically."" Students in all three grade levels take part in PSSA and students enrolled in algebra in the middle school also take the Keystone exam for algebra which is required for graduation. Derry Township School District’s elementary mathematics curriculum is designed to engage all learners in a rigorous, focused and coherent program that develops mathematical thinking, conceptual understanding, problem-solving, reasoning, fluency, and communication. The curriculum is aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards for Mathematics and includes mastery of both content and practice standards.  A deep understanding of mathematical concepts is built through a progression of concrete, representational and abstract learning experiences that help students become effective, efficient, and flexible problem solvers who can represent and communicate their thinking well Students in the Derry Township School District have many opportunities to learn to create, perform, and appreciate music as an integral part of their education. Our curriculum is closely tied to the National Standards for Music Education and the Pennsylvania standards for the Arts and Humanities. The Derry Township School District is proud of its music programs, having been named one of the “Best Communities for Music Education” several times. Many students and ensembles have been recognized at the State and Regional level, and our highly-qualified staff regularly guest conducts and presents clinics at local and regional honors ensembles and conferences. In our elementary schools, students receive comprehensive classroom music education in grades one through five. Students learn to sing, perform, compose, create, movement, folk dance, and experience music through a variety of classroom activities. Additionally, students in grades four and five have the opportunity to participate in our instrumental music program (both band and orchestra) and students in grade five may participate in choir. Our middle school continues classroom music instruction in grades six, seven, and eight. These classes introduce instrumental performance opportunities through the use of keyboards and guitars, and work to ensure that students are familiar with the ways that music is and can be a joyful and important part of their lives, promoting lifelong learning in the art form. The middle school has active band, choir, and orchestra programs. Hershey High School offers a variety of leveled ensembles for vocalists, as well as wind, percussion, and string players.",490
227,"Advanced Placement Music Theory is also offered at the high school level.

The primary goal of physical education in grades 1-5 is to develop students' fundamental movement skills within a variety of developmentally appropriate activities. The program enhances students' personal fitness and provides them with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in a variety of physical activities. Personal and social responsibility, self-directed learning, and problem solving skills are reinforced throughout the 1-5 physical education curriculum. The middle school physical education program strives to develop students' personal fitness and skill-related abilities. The program reinforces students' understanding and application of fitness concepts and motor skills through a variety of movement forms. The program aims to develop students' personal and social responsibility, self-management skills, and ability to make informed choices. The overall goal of this program is to enhance students' disposition toward leading a physically active lifestyle. Pursuit of personal fitness and understanding the benefits of leading a physically active lifestyle is at the core of the high school physical education curriculum. Thus, designing, implementing and assessing personal fitness is the primary goal for the individual student. Refining a variety of movement skills that contribute toward lifelong activity is an essential component of the program. Health Education is a primary focus of the Derry Township School District.  The purpose of this curriculum is to provide pertinent information that allows the students to make prudent decisions based on factual data.  Students are taught to make positive and healthy life choices through the study of basic psychology, body systems, drug and alcohol awareness, and basic first aid. The above curricula, Health, Physical Education, is reflective of the Pennsylvania State Standards and is continuously reviewed and revised.",469
228,"The Derry Township School District’s high school students elect a minimum of three science credits from a suite of academic, honors and advanced placement courses in the physical and life sciences. Students must enroll in at least one biology, one chemistry, and one physics course during their time in high school in order to meet graduation requirements.  The high school program includes core and elective courses at the academic and honors levels and four Advanced Placement courses. Consistent with all outstanding secondary science programs, our program places great emphasis on laboratory work and the integration of technology into the collection, manipulation and presentation of data. Strategic Plan process targets in technology, communication, critical thinking, working cooperatively, applying problem-solving skills, authentic learning experiences and showing responsibility for learning, are supported by the Science curricula. Throughout the course of their three years at Hershey Middle School, Derry Township students take a progression of Science courses entitled Science 6, Science 7, and Science 8. These Science courses cover a variety of standards-based content in the Physical and Life Sciences that builds from year to year using spiraling and scaffolding to ensure that concepts are both age and developmentally appropriate. The sixth grade Science course is designed to be highly engaging and includes instruction in basic Science skills and language that is used by students in grades seven and eight. A wide variety of topics are covered, including Physical Science, Life Science, and Astronomy. The Life Science portion of the sixth-grade curriculum culminates in an end of year, overnight, outdoor field trip to Kenbrook where students get to apply and demonstrate their knowledge of the environment as well as gain an appreciation of their responsibilities as stewards of nature. For many students, the sixth-grade year is the first in which they have Science as a Core area of content and get to experience working with a lab group to complete intensive lab activities, many of which are multiple-day experiences in which they learn how to use Science equipment, follow procedures, and gather and analyze data. The seventh grade Science course is often the first time students experience content taught by Secondary certified instructors. The content is covered to a deeper level and students are asked to think critically and demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of ways, including lab write-ups, multi-paragraph writing assignments, presentations, research projects, and assessments. Once again, a wide variety of content is taught, building upon concepts covered in sixth grade and elementary school.",483
229,"The main area of emphasis is in the area of Environmental Science and Ecology, along with some Earth Science and Chemistry. Good Science skills and common language continue to be emphasized. The seventh-grade year culminates in a trip to the Philadelphia Zoo where students get to see first-hand many of the organisms studied throughout the year. The eighth-grade Science course continues to build on the sixth and seventh-grade years. Content emphasis shifts to more Physical and Biological Sciences. Science skills and concepts are taught with a mind to prepare students for their high school science classes, specifically ninth-grade Biology. This preparation is planned in conjunction with the Hershey High School Science Department in an effort to make the students’ transition from middle school Science to high school Science as seamless as possible. Eighth grade Science students also take the Science PSSA, which is a standardized test used to assess what they have learned thus far in their Science education. The Hershey High School Social Studies Department aims to guide students in developing historical thinking skills, geographic and cultural experience and knowledge, and an understanding of the decisive role of critical thought and tolerance as 21st century global citizens. In 9th grade Civics, students learn how responsible citizens productively engage in a political system. In 10th grade World History, students learn how the changing relationship between human beings and the physical and natural environment affected human life from early times to the present, why relations among humans been so complex since early times, and how human views of the world, nature, and the cosmos have changed. In 11th grade American History, students learn what it means to be an American, how Americans have responded to challenges, and how American democracy has failed and succeeded. From the eleventh grade on, students may also choose to take Money and Power, a course that fuses political science with economics; Law and Society, which fuses law and sociology; and Psychology, in which students investigate the science and study of the human mind. Advanced Placement classes in the Social Studies Department include AP Human Geography, an intensive study of the history and science of the human inhabitation of the planet; AP US History, an intensive study of all of American history; and AP European History, an intensive study of European history since the High Middle Ages.",455
230,"The sixth grade Social Studies curriculum involves the geography, history and culture of the Western Hemisphere while incorporating the five themes of geography.  The teaching and learning encompasses spatial thinking by using maps of the United States, Canada and Latin America.  Thematic maps of our western world, regions of Canada, and urbanization in Mexico City are all focus areas.  Current events enhance connections students are making through classroom engagement.  Mapping Labs create a hands-on approach in working with physical and political features. The infusion of technology and writing within the units of learning rounds out the sixth grade year. In seventh grade students study information about cultures around the Eastern Hemisphere then apply the newly acquired knowledge to real and practical situations. The curriculum includes simulations, role-playing, case studies, group activities, writing and research assignments, projects, key concepts of geography and current events. The students will learn the names of places and where they are located, in the process comparing them to our country and others in order to gain a deeper understanding of the people in those places.  Our goal is to impress upon our students the importance of becoming contributing citizens of our society. In eighth grade, students have a course in American history, American Cultures I.  In this course, we study American history up to and including the Civil War and Reconstruction. The year is broken down into two main topics: 1) the establishment of the government of the United States; and 2) the history of the United States through Reconstruction. The Technology Education Curriculum is an elective course curriculum, that provides all levels of student learners in grades 9 through 12 with courses that target 21st-century technology initiatives and implements a high degree of STEM/STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) components, as they relate to state and national SAS (state assessment standards). Students have the opportunity to engage in courses that provide enrichment into the principles of: Engineering & Design, Architectural Design, Energy, Power & Transportation, Engineering Systems (electronic, mechanical systems, robotics, manufacturing), Digital Media & Photography and Manufacturing Technologies. Students have the advantages of implementing the latest technology tools into these courses, such as advanced CAD (computer-aided design software), 3D printing, CNC/CAM software, EV3 Robotics, etc.  All of these courses have a direct or indirect collaborative connection with relative core subjects and also help students start to develop a pathway to planning for higher education and careers.",494

What should I do once I receive my clearances/certifications? Is there any other screening necessary for school volunteers? Why does Derry Township School District require all of these documents? How much time will it take to receive my certifications? How often do I need to update my clearances/certifications? Who should I contact if I am having trouble completing the applications? Do I need to submit the paperwork or certifications if I want to assist with PTO-sponsored events that are held outside of the school day? Why does the Derry Township School District require certifications? Every day parents and guardians entrust the care of their students to the District and as part of that responsibility, the District wants to ensure that it is doing everything it can to keep students safe. Why do volunteers need all these clearances/certifications? The District requires all three certifications because each represents a unique database of records. The PA child abuse and criminal records are maintained in two different state databases, while the FBI checks criminal history through a national database of criminal records. The mandated reporter training certification is required because the law defines volunteers as mandated reporters.",469
234,"Volunteers are required to submit the following clearances: Section 1418 of the Pennsylvania School Code states, “Each teacher, any other school employee and any person providing services for school children under contract shall be given tests for tuberculosis in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Advisory Health Board. Each student teacher and volunteer participating in student activities shall be given the same tests for tuberculosis, but no person shall be required to submit to a particular test if he shall furnish a statement setting forth adequate reasons for being excused from taking the test. In such case, an alternative method of testing shall be administered. What should I do once I receive my clearances/certifications? Originals of the PA Child Abuse and Criminal Record certifications will be mailed to the applicant’s home address or sent electronically if submitted online. Those originals must be presented to the District’s Human Resource Specialist. A copy of each background check will be made from the original and kept on file in the District office. Applicants should provide to the Human Resource Specialist their PAE Registration # that they received when they registered online for the FBI fingerprint clearance.  The Human Resource Specialist will then review applicant’s report online. Applicants should provide a copy of their mandated reporter training certificate to the Human Resource Specialist. Is there any other screening necessary for school volunteers? Yes, a TB test must be administered within 3 months of registering to volunteer. A copy of the TB test results will be made from the original and kept on file in the District Office. Why does Derry Township School District require all of these documents? The Derry Township Board of School Directors based on the recommendations of the policy committee and the administration, decided to take a conservative approach, believing it to be better to err on the side of safety. Unfortunately, it's a sign of the times we live in. It should be noted that many other school districts in the area also require volunteers to get the three background checks. It is the responsibility of the volunteer to pay for his/her certifications. It depends. The costs for the three background checks totals $23.25. This includes the Pennsylvania Child Abuse History Clearance, the Pennsylvania State Police Criminal Record Check, and the FBI Federal Criminal History Check. Effective July 25, 2015, the fee for volunteers seeking PA Child Abuse History and PA Criminal Record clearances will be waived by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Tuberculosis screening can range between $10 - $90 depending on the location and your individual health insurance coverage.",500

The purpose of the elementary report card within Derry Township School District is to provide a clear and accurate description of each child’s progress in three areas: Performance relative to the Pennsylvania Academic Standards established by the PA Department of Education (PDE). Academic performance relative to Derry Township School District’s curriculum and grade level benchmarks and expectations. Demonstration of the characteristics of a successful learner. In standards-based classrooms, the focus is on a student’s performance over multiple opportunities, not simply the grading and averaging of tests and quizzes. Standards are specified learning goals applied to all students and provide consistent targets for students to meet.  Standards provide a focus for aligning curriculum, instruction and assessment.  They are the general categories that organize knowledge within a discipline.  Each local school district in Pennsylvania develops curriculum aligned to the PA Standards.  In Derry Township School District, the local curriculum exceeds the PA Standards in many areas. A standards-based report card emphasizes “learning” over “earning”. Each quarter provides students multiple opportunities to practice, attain, and demonstrate proficiency on the PA Standards and the Derry Township School District performance benchmarks. Through the identification of clear benchmarks, a student’s knowledge and skills are measured on a continual basis, stretching students to perform at their highest level of potential. Teachers collect evidence of a child’s achievement through careful observations, the examination of the student’s work, discussions, projects, performance tasks, quizzes, and tests. Teachers record information about each child’s progress on a frequent basis, analyze and compile that information, and finally use the data to evaluate each child’s progress. 30 E.",458

Packs(opens in new window/tab)HACC Winter weather can be a stressful event for families. We wanted to relay the following information about expectations for winter weather communication and what that looks like for school days for our families. We thank you for your feedback to improve this process and we hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable winter season. The district has been approved for five Flexible Instructional Days (FID) for the 2023-2024 school year. This means we are able to provide instruction virtually during the event of a full snow day. However, after hearing feedback from our families and throughout the community, we know there is an appreciation for having a “true snow day.” Therefore, on the first full day snow day (where we will not be running a delayed schedule), we will close school and allow our students to have the day off. The remaining 5 snow days will be FID days, if needed. In the summer of 2022, Derry Township School District asked our families to fill out a communication preference survey to further understand how our families would like to be informed of delays or school closures. Based on the results of the survey, the order of communications was updated. The process changes will allow for information to be received faster than previously.",471

The Cat in the Hat tells the story of Horton, an elephant who discovers a speck of dust that contains the Whos, including Jojo, a Who child sent off to military school for thinking too many ‘thinks.’ Horton faces a double challenge: not only must he protect the Whos from a world of naysayers and dangers, but he must guard an abandoned egg, left in his care by the irresponsible Mayzie La Bird. Although Horton faces ridicule, danger, kidnapping and a trial, the intrepid Gertrude McFuzz never loses faith in him. Ultimately, the powers of friendship, loyalty, family and community are challenged and emerge triumphant. TICKET INFORMATION: Online tickets sales end at the start of each the performance. A limited number of General Admission tickets will be available at the door for a price of $20.00 a ticket. Cash or check payment (made payable to HHS Productions) accepted only. Auditorium doors open about 30 minutes before showtime. Questions about tickets can be directed by email to hwhite@hershey.k12.pa.us or by calling 717-531-2244.

354,"Our easy-to-teach program garners outstanding reviews from educators who’ve noticed school-wide improvement and see even the most challenging students make progress in emotion management, situational awareness, and academic achievement. In classrooms from Kindergarten through grade 5, students learn invaluable skills that help them navigate their way through school as well as their community. Second Step’s age-appropriate games, activities, and media engage students and set children on a path to lifelong success. Second Step SEL has been successfully implemented by over 26,000 schools worldwide. The curriculum is designed to align with district standards. Students eagerly anticipate Second Step’s fun, captivating lessons that include games, activities, and songs. The skills they learn are useful in school, on the playground, and at home. Second Step has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) and the Department of Education, for the quality of our research, training, and teacher and family support. It’s never too early to provide students and staff with tools to prevent bullying, both in school and in the community. Based on the latest field research, Second Step’s Bullying Prevention curriculum teaches Kindergarten–Grade 5 students how to recognize, report, and refuse bullying. As students master these crucial skills, educators and school staff learn to recognize and respond appropriately when they observe bullying or receive a bullying report, all while gaining insight into teaching the unit to children. Building on the fundamentals of the Second Step Social Emotional Learning Curriculum, the Committee for Children developed the Bullying Prevention Unit with age-appropriate lessons for elementary classrooms (Kindergarten–Grade 5). Training, lessons, and family resources were developed to put research-based strategies in the hands of educators to create spaces safe for learning. School staff learn to work with all students involved in bullying, including bystanders, for an improved school climate. When all staff learn how to recognize and respond to bullying effectively, students understand that they can trust staff to deal with it appropriately. With the help of acclaimed author Trudy Ludwig, they’ve woven engaging live action and animated videos into every lesson. Family materials extend lessons beyond the classroom and help families distinguish between peer conflict and bullying. The Bullying Prevention Unit includes principal resources, staff training, and student lessons to help everyone learn bullying prevention techniques. 30 E.",491

363,"(Primary residency for both public and non-public school students must be established through the District Registrar.) Eligible students will receive transportation services assigned by the student’s primary home address. The district provides transportations services to elementary students (Grades K-6) who live more than 1.5 miles from their attending school and secondary students (Grades 7-12) Who live more than 2 miles from their attending school. Students who live in a designated walking area that has been declared hazardous by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation will also receive district transportation services. NOTE: Students may still be required to walk up to 1.5 miles to an elementary school or 2 miles to a secondary school bus stop. District students who live within a certain proximity to our schools may not be eligible for transportation services. Walking distances have been set by the Pennsylvania Department of Education and begin where the driveway for a residence meets the public roadway. Under these guidelines, elementary students (Grades K-6) who live less than 1.5 miles from their attending school and secondary students (Grades 7-12) Who live less than 2 miles from their attending school are walkers. Exceptions are made for students whose primary residence is located in an areas declared hazardous by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. DTSD requires 6th graders to follow the secondary student walking area guidelines due to building assignment and bussing schedules for the Middle School and High School. Students who attend a non-public school that is located 10 miles or less by paved public roadway from the DTSD border are eligible for district-provided transportation. DTSD is also required to adhere to the calendar’s start times, finish times and scheduled early dismissal dates when transporting students to Non-Public Schools. Information or changes regarding your student’s transportation should be completed on the DTSD Act 372 form available at your attending school office and submitted to the DTSD Transportation Office. The Transportation Office encourages parents/guardians to submit any address or bus stop changes for their students no later than two weeks prior to the start of school.

378,"Conjunctivitis (Possible Bacteria) - pasty/crusty/purulent drainage around the eye, please keep your child home from school and call a physician. Students found to have live lice will be excluded from school.  The student should return to school as soon as the treatment has been provided, which could be the same day. Readmission will occur when a student is cleared by a school nurse. Literature supports that the only sure way to successfully treat head lice is through mechanical removal of nits, following application of a pediculicidal agent used in accordance with PA Department of Health, PA Department of Education, and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines or in consultation with a primary care provider. Screen by direct inspection of the hair and scalp, using a clean stick(s) for each student. Review findings with the student promptly in a private setting. Inform parent(s)/ guardian(s) of student having head lice and/or viable nits. Inform parent of immediate exclusion of the student from school. The student will be sent home or, if no parent/guardian can be contacted, the student will remain in the Nursing Office until a parent/guardian can be reached. Demonstrate removal of nits when a parent arrives to pick up student (provide handout). Provide instruction to parents and students on appropriate treatment for and prevention of head lice. Advise the classroom teacher of the need for the student to be rechecked immediately upon return to school. Student may not re-enter classroom until cleared by a school nurse. Advise other school nurses of siblings in other school buildings. Within 24 hours, send the Notification of Lice letter home to parents/guardians of students in the classroom following the first indication of lice. Provide notification to appropriate school personnel and information on preventative measures such as: Avoiding shared equipment/items (hats, combs/brushes, helmets) Request for carpeted areas or fabric covered furniture to be vacuum cleaned (then discarding the vacuum cleaner bag immediately) Immediate removal of all cloth pillows, blankets, mats, etc. from the classroom for a minimum of two weeks. All items must be thoroughly cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag during that time. If the school nurse confirms two concurrent cases of head lice in the same classroom, the entire class will be screened individually by the school nurse in the Nursing office. Confidentiality and privacy will be protected at all times.",498

383,"This chapter outlines the requirements and guidelines for providing specialized support and education to students with disabilities. By understanding the provisions of Chapter 14, schools can create inclusive environments where students with disabilities can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Individualized Education Program (IEP): Under Chapter 14, students with disabilities receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that is tailored to their unique needs. The IEP is a personalized plan developed by a team that includes parents, teachers, special education professionals, and the student (when appropriate). It identifies the student's goals, accommodations, modifications, and related services required to facilitate their educational progress. Appropriate Placement: Chapter 14 emphasizes the importance of placing students with disabilities in the most appropriate educational setting. This ensures that students receive the necessary support while also benefiting from interactions with their non-disabled peers. The goal is to provide a Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) that maximizes inclusion and promotes social integration. Access to Special Education Services: Students eligible for special education services, as identified through evaluations and assessments, are entitled to a range of specialized supports. These services may include individual or small group instruction, assistive technology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling, and other related services designed to address their unique needs. Transition Planning: Chapter 14 emphasizes the importance of transition planning for students with disabilities as they prepare for life after high school. The IEP team develops a transition plan that focuses on goals, services, and activities to support a successful transition into post-secondary education, employment, or independent living. This ensures that students are equipped with the necessary skills and resources for a smooth transition to adulthood. Procedural Safeguards: Chapter 14 provides parents and students with procedural safeguards to protect their rights during the special education process. These safeguards include the right to participate in IEP meetings, access to educational records, the ability to request evaluations, and the option to resolve disputes through mediation or due process hearings. These safeguards ensure that families are involved in decision-making and have a voice in their child's education. Collaboration and Professional Development: Chapter 14 emphasizes the importance of collaboration between general education and special education teachers to meet the diverse needs of students. Schools are encouraged to provide ongoing professional development to teachers and staff members to enhance their knowledge and skills in supporting students with disabilities effectively. Chapter 14 of IDEA provides a comprehensive framework for special education services and programs.",492

Students who are evaluated and identified as gifted, according to Pennsylvania Chapter 16 Regulations, may require instruction and support that is matched to their unique abilities and needs. Specially designed instruction for gifted students is individualized and may take various forms both within and outside of the regular classroom. Through collaboration between the school, the parents, and the child, the district strives to develop instruction that will challenge and enrich all learners at an appropriate level. Students may be screened or evaluated and identified as gifted at any time throughout their school career. The process begins with a referral from within the school or a written request from parents and follows with a screening by the school counselor. If students perform well on the screening, they are recommended to the school psychologist for further evaluation under a Gifted Multi-Disciplinary Evaluation (GMDE). When a student moves into the Derry Township School District, the process of identification varies. Gifted Individualized Education Plans (GIEP’s) written by other districts in Pennsylvania will be honored and either implemented or modified as needed to best meet the needs of the student in Derry Township.  Students with identification as gifted in another state may need to undergo screening with the school counselor and/or evaluation with the school psychologist and will need to meet the criteria for identification as set by the Derry Township School District, in accordance with Pennsylvania’s Chapter16 Regulations. Once a student is identified as gifted, a GIEP team will be convened to develop an individualized plan to address the student’s needs. The team generally consists of the child’s regular classroom teacher(s), the gifted support teacher, school psychologist, and a building administrator. Questions regarding screening, evaluation, eligibility, due process rights, or provision of gifted education services may be directed to the school principal or the Director of Psychological Services.",482

District Solicitor: William J. Zee, Esq., Appel, Yost, & Zee, LLP Mrs. Honesta Romberger* hromberger@hershey.k12.pa.us School directors are elected on odd-numbered years to four-year terms. During the first week of December, the board elects a president and vice president to serve one-year terms starting immediately. The board also elects a treasurer and secretary in May to one and four-year terms respectively. Their terms begin in July. The School Board is a policy-making body.

480,"The use of medications, both prescription and nonprescription (also known as over-the-counter), must be in strict accord with School District policy.  The school nurse, another licensed person delegated by the nurse, or the student’s parents, with no exceptions, must administer all medication, prescription or nonprescription. For all medication, a current written order from the licensed prescriber is required.  In some circumstances, the District will accept a verbal order by a licensed prescriber, to be followed by a written order within twenty-four (24) hours.  This should include the name of the child, date of prescription, name of the medication, dosage, and route of administration, specific time or special circumstances under which the medication shall be administered, and signature of the prescriber.  E-mails are not acceptable. All prescription medicine must be in the original container and labeled with the child's name, medication name, dosage, time, and route of administration.  Ask the pharmacist for a ""school bottle"" with a complete label and the amount of medication that will be needed at school.  Nonprescription or over-the-counter medication must be in the original, unopened bottle with a readable label. When a medication order is received, a medication card may be sent home with the student to be signed by the child's parent and returned to the school nurse the following day. Parent signature allows the district to comply with the written medication order.  No emails will be accepted as permission. Medications, permitted by standing order from the school physician (antibiotic ointment, hydrocortisone, etc.) or by parent signature (pain and fever meds) on the blue Emergency Card, may be administered by the school nurse. No prescription or nonprescription medications may be in a student’s possession at any time, with the exception of asthma inhalers and epinephrine auto-injectors, which require medical and parent permission.  The School District medication policy provides specific procedures for students to follow regarding delivery to school and storage of medications, both prescription and nonprescription.  Immediately on arrival to school, students must bring all prescription or nonprescription medication to the school nurse.  Verification of the medication and count will be completed and documented at that time. The parent will be notified if there is a discrepancy in the medication or count.",482

Packs(opens in new window/tab)HACC The Pennsylvania Criminal Record Check can be done either online or by mail. The online results are available almost immediately, while if you choose to mail the form, it could take up to 8 weeks for the results to be returned to you. Complete the process online. Once on the site, click on “Submit a New Record Check” and follow the instructions. Please select “Volunteer” as the Reason for Request.  At the end of the process, you will need to print the certification form. If you do not print or save the certification form the state will require you to submit a new request and charge you an additional processing fee of $10.00. If you choose the mail-in process, click Criminal Background Check Form and print out the form.  You must submit the completed form to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the results will be mailed to your home. If you have your Pennsylvania Criminal Record Check from another organization that was obtained less than one year from the current date, you may submit this document in lieu of completing a new application (provided the reason for the request indicated “Education or volunteer”). In addition, the Pennsylvania Criminal Record Check is only valid for 5 years (60 months) from the date issued. In order to continue to volunteer in the District, you must renew your Pennsylvania Criminal Record Check every five years from the date of issue.",497

545,"Below please find information regarding the definition, school rules, and legislation that surrounds bullying. “A person is being bullied or victimized when exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons” (Olweus 1991). ""Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems"" (StopBullying.Gov) In order to be considered bullying, the behavior must be aggressive and include: An Imbalance of Power: Students who bully use their power—such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity—to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people. Repetition: Bullying behaviors happen more than once or have the potential to happen more than once. Bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose. This definition is provided to exclude occasional, non-serious, peer conflict or negative actions that are directed at one student at one time and/or against another student on a different occasion. If you are being bullied or you witness someone being bullied, immediately tell an adult (at school and at home). Because bullying can be covert and is not always obvious to a bystander, it is important to report the behavior. DO NOT assume that an adult knows that it is occurring. Parents/Guardians, please contact a school official (Principal and/or School Counselor) to assure they are aware of the bullying so that it may be addressed immediately. We will include students who are easily left out (at lunch, at recess, in group activities, etc.) When we know someone is being bullied, we will tell an adult at school and an adult at home Derry Township School District Policy 249, Bullying/Cyberbullying was adopted March 23, 2009. The policy has been and will continue to be reviewed by the Board of School Directors Policy Committee every three years. The policy is accessible in every classroom in the District and is posted within each school building, excerpts within the parent/student handbooks, as well as on the District web site.",488
546,"All staff K-12 (professional and support) were trained in the Olweus Bullying Prevention model and philosophy in 2007 and each building developed Bullying Prevention Committees to provide the oversight for the development of policy, procedures, education and information. Each year, as part of the opening day inservice, staff receive “refreshers” regarding the guidelines for bullying prevention, any new updates in process/procedure, trends, or concerns (i.e.: continued increase in Cyberbullying). Please note that the focus is not just on “bullying.” Although this is a concern, the overarching objective for a positive school climate is a more appropriate goal as not all inappropriate interactions are “bullying” (exposure, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more persons). The High School and Middle School students receive information on policies, procedures and supports regarding bullying each year during opening day inservicing as well as throughout the year as is needed to refresh (specifically after any documented incidents). The Elementary students receive the same, but in the form of classroom lessons with their school counselors. In addition, with the support of funds from the Safe Schools Initiative Grant, we were able to update all of our Second Step Social Emotional Learning kits K-5 and included the Bullying Prevention curriculum as well (see Second Step page for more information). The new curricula is supported with training for all admin and staff K-5 to ensure a seamless transition for the new school year. As a District, we continue to be vigilant, work to maintain consistent guidelines, provide opportunities to educate parents/community, and implement supports as well as appropriate consequences as needed. In 2008, the Public School Code of 1949 was amended (24 PS 13-1303.1-A) and requires schools to develop a policy relating to bullying. The following outlines the requirements of Pennsylvania’s legislation. Incorporate the policy into the code of student conduct. The policy shall delineate disciplinary consequences for bullying. Identify the appropriate school staff person to receive reports of incidents of alleged bullying. ""Bullying"" shall mean an intentional electronic, written, verbal or physical act, or a series of acts that: Occurs in a school setting. “School setting” shall mean in the school, on school setting grounds, in school vehicles, at a designated bus stop or at any activity sponsored, supervise or sanctioned by the school.",489

Gawel, Assistant Principal of Hershey Elementary School (4th and 5th grades) in the Derry Township School District, has been named Pennsylvania’s 2023 Outstanding Assistant Principal of the Year by the Pennsylvania Principals Association. As a state winner in the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) National Outstanding Assistant Principal (NOAP) of the Year Program, Mrs. Gawel is eligible for consideration to be named the NAESP National Outstanding Assistant Principal of the Year. Kristin Musselman, Chairperson of the PA Principals Association’s Outstanding Assistant Principal Award Selection Committee, said, “It has been an honor to work with Anna Gawel. She is an administrator who leads with heart. She brings a positive attitude and positive mindset to the teachers and staff members that she works with on a daily basis. Among her colleagues, Anna is described as being a person of high integrity and as an assistant principal who leads with passion. Through our interactions and based on her recent accomplishments, it is clear that Mrs. Gawel is invested in her students, teachers and the school community. It is for these reasons that the PA Principals Association is proud to recommend her for this award.” Mrs. Gawel has served as assistant principal at Hershey Elementary School since 2014. She has been an educator for 20 years, beginning her career as a first-grade teacher (2003-2013) and then as an instructional coach (2013-2014) also in the Derry Township School District. Stacy L.",499
605,"Winslow, Ed.D., Superintendent of Derry Township School District, said, “Mrs. Gawel is an exceptional leader. Her devotion to her students and staff is evident in her personal knowledge of their circumstances, needs and strengths. She has led a phenomenal professional learning experience for teaching staff in the last several years and in doing so has fostered growth in district priority areas that can be seen throughout the elementary staff. She is very deserving of this award.” During her tenure as an assistant principal at Hershey Elementary School, Mrs. Gawel organized and created an online professional development course for differentiated supervision. The course began as a pilot and is focused on district goals and is personalized for the staff members taking the course. It has grown over the past five years to encompass over 50 teachers and staff members at the elementary, middle and high school levels. The district has provided intensive staff development at the elementary level around the Professional Learning Community (PLC) process for their staff members and administrative team. Mrs. Gawel, along with the elementary administrative team, revised their schedule to allow this collaboration during the school day, which resulted in improved expertise in examining data and utilizing best practices. “Our district has focused on becoming a PLC because we know the value of collaboration in teaching and learning,” explained Mrs. Gawel. In addition, Mrs. Gawel was instrumental in the implementation of a Multi-Tiered System of Supports/Response to Instruction and Intervention (MTSS/RtII) through a WIN (What I Need) model and developed highly functioning teams that are meeting the needs of all learners. She said, “This process has truly embodied the idea of ‘team’ and why it is so important in education.” Mrs. Gawel shared, “My hope for when people look back at my time in this role is that they will view my most significant contributions to my school as having been my relationships with the students, families and staff in Derry Township School District. I want the school to be a community that fosters belonging, strong community ties, values learning/growth and feels safe and welcoming. At the end of the day, if the people around me can say they felt valued, supported, heard and connected to our school community, I have done my job.” In addition to being a member of the PA Principals Association and NAESP, Mrs. Gawel belongs to the National Association for Educational Communication and Technology and the Pennsylvania State Education Association.",494

DTSD School Psychs receive National Association of School Psychologists' Excellence in School Psychological Services Recognition In January 2020, the Derry Township school psychological services program and staff received the recognition of “Proficient” status from the National Association of School Psychologists’ (NASP) Excellence in School Psychological Services (ESPS) Recognition Program.  This recognition reflects the organizational commitment and hard work of Derry Township School District school psychologists who support the learning and mental health needs of all students so that they can thrive in school, at home, and throughout life.  Only 6 school districts in the country received this designation!   Derry Township's school psychologists and masters/doctoral level school psychology interns help children and youth succeed academically, socially, and emotionally. They collaborate with administrators, educators, parents, and other professionals to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments for all students that strengthen connections between home and school. Derry Township’s school psychologists and masters/doctoral level school psychology interns work to find the best solution for each student and situation and use varied strategies to address student needs and to improve school and district-wide support systems. The school psychologists and masters/doctoral level school psychology interns work with students individually and in groups. They also develop programs to train teachers and parents regarding effective teaching and learning strategies, effective techniques to manage behavior at home and in the classroom, and working with students with disabilities or with special talents. Through participation in the Hershey Intervention and Prevention Program (HIP), issues concerning the abuse of drugs and other substances, and preventing and managing crises are also addressed. Derry Township’s school psychologists and masters/doctoral level school psychology interns are active participants on various teams in each building, including, Data Teams, Intervention Planning Teams, Intervention Teams, Student Assistance Teams (HIP), assist with the development of Transition Plans and 504/Chapter 15 Service Agreements, and regularly participate in regular and special education programs.",470

Packs(opens in new window/tab)HACC Derry Township School District has made the decision to dismiss school early on April 8, 2024 due to the solar eclipse. An eclipse occurs when the moon partially or totally covers the sun. The April 8th eclipse is scheduled to begin at approximately 2:06 pm, reach its maximum at 3:21 pm and end at approximately 4:33 pm. Due to the timing of the eclipse coinciding with student dismissal at our Primary and Secondary buildings, we will dismiss all students at the times listed below as a precautionary measure for student safety. This day will be an early dismissal regardless of the weather conditions (sunny, cloudy). High School and Middle School Dismissal: 12:00PM (Lunch will be served) ECC and Elementary Dismissal: 1:00PM (Lunch will be served) Athletics schedules have been adjusted to occur after the eclipse event has completed. Athletes should check coaches for more information. Kindergarten Registration will continue as planned for the evening of April 8th. The solar eclipse is an excellent educational opportunity for all of our students and families. We will take advantage of this in our classrooms to share more about this amazing scientific and historic event. However, we do want everyone to take extreme caution when viewing the eclipse. While the moon moves across the sun’s bright face, it is dangerous to look directly at it without proper eye protection. We encourage families to visit NASA’s website at https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/ for more information about solar eclipse safety and ideas for safely viewing the solar eclipse and we ask that you reinforce safety precautions with your students at home. 30 E.",476

Packs(opens in new window/tab)HACC The continued safety of our students is a top priority and in compliance with recent legislative changes (Act 44, 45 and 153 of 2014) DTSD has updated our school board policies. These changes have a direct impact on our valued volunteers. Pennsylvania law now includes more stringent requirements for checking the background of those in contact with students; these provisions apply to employees and volunteers.  Effective July 1, 2015. Derry Township School District volunteers must provide updated certifications every 60 months (5 years). In addition, state law now includes volunteers as among those who are deemed “mandated reporters” of child abuse and neglect. Volunteers at DTSD are required to undergo Mandated Reporter training approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education and provide proof of successful completion of that training every 60 months (5 years). Finally, volunteers are required to have a Tuberculosis (TB) test and provide a copy of the official results to the school district before working with students. A new TB screening needs to be completed if a volunteer does not renew their certifications within 12 months of expiration. In summary: serving as a school volunteer now requires you to give more than just your time helping in class and more than ever we appreciate those who are willing to volunteer.",481

693,"Consequently, practitioners need to adopt a defensible methodology for selecting evidence-based educational interventions to solve common academic and social behavior problems. Specifically, a framework is needed for the selection of functionally relevant, evidence-based interventions. The most defensible methodology for intervention selection is to adopt a functional approach to understanding academic and social behavior problems. Using this approach, all incorporated interventions are selected based on evidence that they provide a logical solution to the problem at hand. The EBI Network has been developed to provide guidance in the selection and implementation of evidence-based interventions in the classroom setting. There are four general categories of resources on the EBI Network: Evidenced Based Intervention Network - University of Missouri What works in education? The Best Evidence Encyclopedia (BEE) presents reliable, unbiased reviews of research-proven educational programs to help: Policy Makers use evidence to make informed choices. Principals choose proven programs to meet state standards. Researchers find rigorous evaluations of educational programs. Best Evidence Encyclopedia - Johns Hopkins School of Education Intensive intervention (both academic interventions and behavior interventions) is intended to help these students. The Center's approach to intensive interventions is data-based individualization (DBI). DBI uses data to individualize instruction, increase engagement, and provide opportunities to practice new skills. Within multi-tiered systems of support such as RTI or PBIS, this is often considered Tier III. Learn more about the DBI Framework, meet Center Staff, visit the Tools Charts to find evidence-based progress monitoring tools or interventions, and view the DBI Training Series to find professional development materials to support the implementation of DBI in schools and districts. The Promising Practices Network (PPN) website is a unique resource that offers credible, research-based information on what works to improve the lives of children and families. Sometimes referred to as a ""best practices"" site or a ""model program"" site, PPN is both of those things and much more. In addition to providing summaries of effective programs in our Programs that Work section, PPN also features Issue Briefs that summarize the current research on various topics, as well as Expert Perspectives, where child policy experts answer our visitors' most pressing questions on a variety of topics. PPN also links to additional research information in all areas related to child well-being, including their physical and mental health, academic success, and economic security.",488
694,"To promote successful implementation of best practices and model programs, PPN also screens and posts evidence-based information on effective Service Delivery. In addition to the breadth of information PPN provides, visitors can rely on PPN to provide information that has met our high standards for scientific credibility, objectivity, and clarity. Learn about our process for reviewing information for inclusion on the site and how to submit a program for consideration.

For the first day of school, we invite parents to send us a photo of their student(s) on their first day. We have provided a sign you can use but also invited them to make their own! We will be taking all of the submissions and compiling them into a video to be sent out on social media to our school community. To make things easier for you, we have created DTSD ""My First Day of"" signs that you can print out from home for your first day. Feel free to make your own sign too! We love creativity. First-day photos for the video must be submitted to our online form by August 31. By submitting your photo, you grant the Derry Township School District permission to use your image online unless otherwise stated. Be sure to include your child's name and grade in the online form. Names will not be used in the video but will assist in organizing submissions. You do not have to use one of our signs to be in the video; however, please be mindful of what personal information is available in your photo. Only include your own children in your photo submission.",482

Student-athletes who have been diagnosed with a concussion will be monitored daily by the Athletic Trainers.  They will complete a ""Symptom Score"" sheet that includes 22 different signs and symptoms people may experience with concussions. Headache, dizziness, disruption of sleep, sensitivity to light and sound, as well as difficulty concentrating in school are among the most commonly recorded symptoms.  Every concussion is different and will present slightly differently.  The typical return-to-sport time is about a week to 10 days, but as every concussion presents differently, they all heal differently as well. While healing, athletes are encouraged to avoid activities that increase their symptoms and get plenty of ""brain rest"".  This includes little-to-no video games, texting, computer time, and reading...all of these activities require the eyes to intently focus on the activity...and usually increase symptoms. If watching television or movies doesn't bother the individual, they are permitted to do so, as these activities usually allow the brain to ""zone out"".",473

769,"In addition to being able to view the meeting in real time, online attendees also have the same opportunity to participate in public comment as those in-person.  Pre-registration is required. Board meetings are open to the public and are primarily held on the second and fourth Monday of each month at 7 p.m. in the Derry Township School District Office at 30 East Granada Avenue, Hershey. Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed. * Note:  Monday, Dec. 4 is the annual reorganization meeting School Board meeting agendas can be accessed through the Derry Township School District's AgendaManager site.  Meetings proceed based on an agenda that follows guidelines established in the Pennsylvania School Code. The district administration and school board members recommend agenda items. The board president, elected by fellow directors, presides at all meetings. The vice president presides in the president’s absence. The School Board benefits from comments and questions raised by visitors at board meetings. Those who wish to address the board can do so at two designated places on the agenda. At the appropriate time, the visitor should rise, step to the microphone, and pronounce his/her name clearly for the Board Secretary to record. Visitors no longer need to state their address for the record out loud during public comment. We ask that they complete an address card if attending in person or submit their address if attending via zoom. School Directors and the Superintendent may ask questions or make responding comments. Visitor remarks should be limited to five minutes or less. The president reserves the right to limit discussion whenever he or she deems it appropriate to maintain proper conduct. Consistent with Pennsylvania state laws regarding public meetings and open records, the Derry Township School District maintains minutes of the official actions taken by the Board of School Directors. For the convenience of its constituents, the district posts copies of the official minutes here. Minutes are not official until approved by the board; therefore, minutes are not posted until such time as they have been voted upon and made official - typically at the subsequent board meeting. Beginning with the 2012-13 School Year, the Derry Township Board of School Directors also posts digital audio files from its public meetings. While the recordings may be used in the preparation of minutes, they do not substitute for official, legally approved minutes. 30 E.",480

Ensuring open and honest government is a bedrock principle of democracy. In keeping with this philosophy, the district recognizes the importance of access to public records. The public has the right to inspect and to procure copies of such records (with certain, legally defined exceptions) subject to Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law, a series of laws designed to guarantee that the public has access to public records of governmental bodies. A revised Right to Know or Open Records Law (Act 3 of 2008) took effect on January 1, 2009. This law presumes that all documents of all governmental bodies will be presumed to be open to the public unless the agency holding them can prove otherwise. Derry Township School District is posting the following information as a service to its constituents and in compliance with Section 504 of the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law. The Board of School Directors has established Policy 801, which outlines and defines the processes to be followed pertaining to inquiries in conjunctions with Pennsylvania's Right to Know legislation.",498

847,"Safety requires the cooperation of students, parents/guardians, and school personnel. Parents/guardians should review and discuss school bus rules with their child/children in an effort to help them understand and assume responsibility for good school bus conduct. Students are charged with the responsibility of conduct that will result in safe transportation, respect for all school personnel and respect for other students. Failure to abide by the school bus rules, show proper respect to others, and comply with requests of school personnel may result in a student being issued a School Bus Conduct Report and subsequent suspension or denial of bus transportation. As the safety of students is our highest priority, the district relies on parents/guardians as active partners. If possible, a responsible adult should be close to the bus stop at drop-off time for elementary students. We recommend that parents and caregivers are out of their homes and/or vehicles and visible to their children and their bus driver. Kindergarten students riding home from school on DTSD buses, however, will only be discharged from their buses if a parent/guardian or other authorized caregiver is present to meet the child. If we are unable to make contact with a family member before the end of the bus run, the student will be taken to the Primary/Intermediate Elementary School Office until an authorized family member is able to pick them up. (PLEASE NOTE: At neighborhood/development bus stops serving a large number of families it is not possible for a bus driver to ensure that every child is greeted at their stop due to the volume of students departing from the vehicle and dispersing in various directions.) Implement a “Bus Stop Buddy” system; discuss with your child that they should walk home with an older sibling and/or other older neighborhood children. If you cannot meet your child at the bus stop, develop a family plan and discuss with your child what they should do if no one is there to rendezvous with them. Do you want to go to their house? A friend’s house? A trusted neighbor’s house? Maintain and communicate your contingency plans to your family, friends and/or trusted neighbors to be as prepared as possible for various situations that may arise. When unexpected emergencies arise, don’t hesitate to call your child’s school building office and the Transportation Department (717-566-7422). Be ready and waiting outside for your bus five (5) minutes prior to your scheduled pick-up time.",479
848,"The bus driver is not expected to stop the bus and traffic unless they know that the student will be taking the bus. Be outside and be visible!! Be on time to be courteous to the other motorists and fellow students that are waiting for the bus. Students who have to walk to their assigned bus stop: Use a direct route from home to the bus stop and from the bus stop to home. Do not accept a ride to the bus stop from another person. Ensure that no vehicles are approaching or that all vehicles have stopped completely. Use crosswalks, traffic signals, and pedestrian traffic signals (where available). Wear bright colored clothing, to increase visibility to motorists. When waiting for the bus-stand at least (10) feet from the edge of the roadway whenever possible. Never walk towards a moving school bus-wait for the bus to stop and for the doors to open. Respect other people’s property and be respectful and courteous to other people waiting at the bus stop. Parents/guardians should accompany students to/from the bus stop whenever possible. School rules apply to student behavior while at bus stops. Consult student handbooks and other school documentation for school rules. Oversized items including oversized backpacks, oversized athletic bags, large musical instruments, skateboards and the like are not permitted on any Derry Township School Bus or Van due to safety concerns associated with delays and difficulty during the boarding process and our inability to safely secure larger items in the seating area. Students must be able to carry his/her belongings with ease and hold their belongings on their lap-not in a seat or aisle which could block emergency exits in the event of an emergency Warn pedestrians and motorists that the bus is approaching a bus stop. No one should walk towards the bus when the yellow lights are flashing because the bus may still be moving. Warn pedestrians and motorists that the bus is stopped at a school bus stop. All motorists are required to come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the red warning lights are turned off. When the bus driver opens the door completely, students may board the bus. Students may need to cross the road in front of the bus. Wait for the driver to signal you to cross the street. Always use the handrail to avoid slipping while on the steps of the bus. Find your assigned seat (if applicable) and sit down immediately (back to seat back, and bottom on the seat.) Remain seated until the bus arrives at your destination-school or home.",491
849,"When the bus driver closes the door and the red lights are not flashing, the bus will begin to move away from the bus stop. Everyone must be ten (10) feet away from the bus after its doors have closed. NEVER run or walk towards the school bus after the doors have closed. Parents/Guardians are responsible for taking students to school who miss the bus. Do not follow the bus to another bus stop location, your child will not be allowed to board at any stop other than their assigned bus stop. Failure to abide by the School Bus Safety Guidelines may result in school personnel issuing one or more of the following consequences: Change in seat assignment (at discretion of the Bus Driver, Administration or other DTSD staff). Written notification from the school vehicle driver to the building Principal/Designee and the parent/guardian. The school Principal/Designee determines which disciplinary step(s) will be taken in response to the report. Parent/Guardian cooperation is greatly appreciated in addressing student behavioral issues that occur on DTSD vehicles. Students must board and exit the bus at their assigned bus stop. Students may not ride another bus route to or from school with another student for any reason. Notes from parents granting a student permission to get on or off any other stop other than their assigned stop will not be honored. Parents/Guardians are responsible for transporting students to or from a friend’s house when necessary – students may only ride their assigned buses. No Exceptions. Parents/Guardians requesting to permanently change their child’s bus stop must do so in writing to the Administrative Assistant of Transportation with a minimum of 48 hours' notice. The requested bus stop is found on the same bus route that the student is currently assigned In the event of an emergency situation, a student may be granted permission to get off the bus at an alternate location on the same bus route. In this case, the Transportation Office must be contacted prior to the time of the occurrence with an explanation of the emergency.

This section of the Derry Township School District website is intended to provide information about opportunities and programs that may be of interest to community members, such as volunteer opportunities or how to request the use of district facilities. In addition, this area can also be used to connect current students and their families with community activities and events which may help enrich or expand educational opportunities outside the classroom setting. Graduates of Hershey High School may request official transcripts by completing an easy online form. If your graduating class is planning a reunion, email us the information and we’ll share it out on the district’s social media feeds.  Email us the graduating class year (ie. Class of 1990) along with reunion date/time/location details.  Please also provide any other information your classmates might also find useful, such a link to a reunion web site or the name and email/phone number of a reunion contact person. Derry Township School District may permit community organizations to use district buildings or grounds for approved special events. Inquiries or requests to use district facilities must be made through the Buildings and Grounds Office. The district will process requests on a first-come, first-served basis, except that school groups will be given priority over external groups.",482

Research indicates a positive correlation between attendance and academic achievement. Consequently, a maximum of ten (10) cumulative lawful absences, as confirmed by parental notification, may be allowed within a school year. The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) advises that all absences should be considered unlawful until the District receives a written explanation detailing the reasons for the absence. Therefore, parents/guardians and students must provide a written excuse within three (3) calendar days of the absence. Failure to provide a written explanation within three (3) days may result in the absence being permanently marked as unlawful. Parents/Guardians can check their child’s attendance record in ParentVUE at any time. It's a good idea to check in from time to time to confirm your child’s attendance is documented accurately. Below are the absence codes and definitions used by the District.",482

As of Dec. 31, 2014, requests for clearance statements (now called “certifications”) may be made free-of-charge online.  Effective July 25, 2015, the fee for volunteers seeking PA Child Abuse History and PA Criminal Record clearances will be waived by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The first thing you will do is to create a sign-on (Keystone ID).  You will be asked for your Keystone ID #, this is a number that you created for yourself. The mail-in form must be completed and mailed to the Department of Public Welfare. (Click here to download the Child Abuse History Certification.) Please select “Volunteer” as the Reason for Request. Do not send cash or a personal check. This certification takes approximately 5 – 10 weeks and the results are mailed to your home. If you have your Child Abuse History Certification from another organization that was obtained less than one year from the current date, you may submit this document in lieu of completing a new application (provided the reason for the request indicated “School Employee or Volunteer”). In addition, the Child Abuse History Certification is only valid for five years (60months) from the date issued.",479

This potential reduction in school property tax comes to you via a homestead and/or farmstead assessment exclusion for qualifying properties. To qualify, the property must be used as the primary residence of the owner(s). Applications to potentially eligible property owners who do not have an approved application on file will be mailed on or about December 15th. You must apply to be approved for the reduction in assessment by filing a Homestead and/or Farmstead application with the Dauphin County Office of Tax Assessment between December 15th and March 1st. The Taxpayer Relief Act provides for property tax reduction allocations to be distributed by the Commonwealth to each school district.",459

933,"Enacted in 1975, IDEA promotes inclusive education by providing support, services, and safeguards for students with disabilities. This summary aims to outline the key provisions and benefits of IDEA, emphasizing its role in fostering an inclusive and equitable learning environment for all students. Purpose: IDEA was established to guarantee that students with disabilities receive an education that meets their unique needs. It ensures that every child, regardless of their disability, has the right to access a quality education, develop their full potential, and prepare for a successful transition into adulthood. Eligibility: IDEA covers children and youth, ages 3 to 21, who have been identified as having a disability and require special education and related services. Eligible disabilities may include specific learning disabilities, autism, speech and language impairments, intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbances, and other health impairments. Individualized Education Program (IEP): One of the core principles of IDEA is the development of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for each eligible student. The IEP is a personalized document that outlines the student's unique needs, goals, and the services and accommodations required to support their learning. It is created collaboratively by a team, which typically includes parents, teachers, special education professionals, and the student (when appropriate). Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE): IDEA guarantees that eligible students with disabilities receive a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). This means that schools must provide educational services and supports to meet the individual needs of students at no cost to their families. The education provided should be tailored to enable students to make meaningful progress and participate in the general education curriculum to the greatest extent possible. Related Services and Supports: IDEA ensures that students with disabilities receive necessary related services and supports to facilitate their educational progress. These services may include speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling, assistive technology, transportation, and more. The specific services are determined based on the individual needs identified in the student's IEP. Least Restrictive Environment (LRE): IDEA promotes the concept of the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), which emphasizes the inclusion of students with disabilities in general education classrooms to the maximum extent appropriate. The LRE principle recognizes that students benefit from being educated alongside their non-disabled peers, while still receiving the necessary supports and accommodations. Procedural Safeguards: IDEA provides parents and students with a range of procedural safeguards to protect their rights throughout the special education process.",495

We're in the preliminary stages of planning for both renovation and new construction options. The estimated timeline for either path is around two years, and the work will be completed in phases. While we haven't fully finalized our plans, a key aspect we're actively addressing is how to manage student classrooms and movement around the school during construction and demolition phases. This will be a critical part of our planning process moving forward. Will the students stay on site during demolition and construction of this project? We haven't finalized the specifics on whether students will remain on-site during the construction period. However, we are committed to keeping the community informed. As we develop our plans, we will continue to hold community meetings and present at Board Meetings to share updates and gather input. The safety and well-being of our students will be a top priority in our decision-making process.",462
958,"What are the design standards that have changed in the last 20 years? Over the last 20 years, design standards for educational facilities have evolved significantly, especially in two key areas: Safety and Security: The focus has shifted towards layered security measures and improved supervision of students. Academic spaces are now designed to be more remote from the main entrance, further enhancing the safety measures in place. Student-Centric Learning Environments: Traditional ""sit and get"" instructional spaces are giving way to more dynamic, student-centered designs. This includes the use of flexible furniture and the incorporation of breakout spaces to facilitate collaborative learning and engagement. These changes reflect a more holistic approach to school design, emphasizing both the safety and educational needs of students. What is the general cost per square foot for demolition and construction? The general cost for demolition and construction varies based on the complexity of the scope of work and construction type. The cost analysis in the presentation compared renovations and additions of the existing ES to new construction of similar square footage. The proposed costs are not intended to be a design solution but an analysis to determine the cost effectiveness to renovate or replace the elementary school. The cost per square feet of renovation ranges from $175-$195 per SF and building additions at $350-$375 plus construction cost escalation and contingency of approximately 13%.  The cost for all new construction ranges from $275-$290 per SF and building demolition at $6 per SF with construction cost escalation and contingency of approximately 13%. The estimates are based on our experience of projects with similar size and scope in Pennsylvania, which serve as a benchmark for judging costs in our planning process. It was noted in CRA’s cost analysis and the cost estimates of the two previous studies, conducted by other Architectural firms, that renovation plus additions of the existing elementary are approximately 80% of new construction cost estimates. The PA Department of Education recommends to highly consider building replacement when the 80% threshold is reached. What consultations will be used to address noises and other disruptions to students such as humming of lights or loud toilet flushers? To address concerns related to noise and other disruptions like the humming of lights or loud toilet flushers, we have a multi-faceted approach: We work with specialized consultants in plumbing, electrical, and HVAC who have expertise in K-12 building design. This ensures that the systems installed are well-suited for a school environment.",480
959,"We continually seek feedback from previous builds to identify areas for improvement, helping us to make more informed decisions for current and future projects. We're exploring options like low-flow toilets and manual flush mechanisms to mitigate the noise generated by plumbing systems. Additionally, for specific areas where noise could be a concern, we would bring in an acoustical consultant to provide expert recommendations. By utilizing these resources and methods, we aim to minimize disruptions and create a conducive learning environment for our students. Was the cost presented tonight for the design in the same presentation? Why would a PIAA-regulation gym be needed in an elementary school? ​​There are several compelling reasons to consider including a PIAA-regulation gym in an elementary school: Our elementary school often serves as a host location for district-wide student events, making a gymnasium that meets PIAA standards a valuable asset for accommodating a larger number of attendees. The enhanced gym space would also be available for rental for community events and youth organizations, serving as a multi-purpose facility for the wider community. Beyond its traditional use for physical education classes, a larger gym with greater seating capacity offers flexibility for various activities and functions, such as assemblies, thereby maximizing the utility of the space. Incorporating a PIAA-regulation gym would not only benefit our elementary school students but also provide broader advantages for our district and community. Would a new building with a central gymnasium and MPR cut down on travel time for students? The benefits of having a central gymnasium and Multi-Purpose Room (MPR) along with constructing a multi-story building is that it could further optimize travel time and space utilization. With a vertical design, students can more quickly navigate between classrooms and key facilities like the gym and MPR, which would be centrally located. This setup reduces the overall footprint of the building, making it more efficient. Moreover, a multi-story structure allows for better zoning of educational spaces, potentially grouping age-appropriate classrooms and facilities together on the same floor for added convenience and safety. Having these key facilities centrally located means students would spend less time walking to and from various activities, whether it's physical education classes, assemblies, or special events. This efficient design would allow for smoother transitions between activities and optimize the use of instructional time.",458
960,"Are you going to have security experts consult on this project? Yes, security is a top priority for us in this project, and we have multiple avenues to ensure it's adequately addressed: Crabtree, Rorhbaugh and Associates has certified experts on staff to guide us on best practices for safety and security. These certifications are provided by law enforcement agencies and emphasize security through environmental design. We have the option to engage a third-party consultant to conduct a comprehensive security assessment, providing an additional layer of expertise. (This is work that the district has engaged in previously and is seeking to update in the near future). We will also collaborate with our Director of Safe and Supportive Schools as well as local law enforcement agencies to integrate their insights into our planning. Beyond consultations, we'll be implementing design principles specifically aimed at enhancing safety and security throughout school facilities. By taking these steps, we aim to create an environment that is not only conducive to learning but also ensures the well-being of our students, staff, and visitors. Why did the cost per square foot change from High School quoted 7 years ago to today’s cost? The change in cost per square foot from the High School project quoted seven years ago to today's cost can be attributed to a variety of factors. In general, construction costs have been subject to market forces, inflation, and other variables that can result in changes over time. It's essential to understand that each project has its own set of circumstances and requirements, making direct cost comparisons challenging. We did choose to work with CRA for this project, a firm known for delivering the most cost-effective designs per square foot in the state. Their reputation for economical yet quality builds was a key factor in their selection. Are special education rooms different from General education classrooms? It depends. Special education rooms are generally designed to be different from general education classrooms, although the extent of the differences depends on various factors. Faculty Input: We plan to consult with faculty members, particularly those who specialize in special education, to better understand their specific needs and teaching methods. Their insights will be invaluable in tailoring the room designs to better serve students with special needs. Types of Needs: The actual differences in the room layouts and amenities will depend on the types of needs that are most commonly encountered among the students using them. This could mean specialized furniture, sensory-friendly materials, and adaptive technologies, among other features.",479

1000,"Click here to view the online Pennsylvania Secondary Transition Guide sponsored by the PA Department of Education, Bureau of Special Education on behalf of the Pennsylvania Community on Transition. Created by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the purpose of this checklist is to empower and enable students with disabilities and their families in planning for life beyond high school. Transition planning is a process required by federal and state law. Any student who will be turning 14 during the duration of the IEP must begin the transition planning process; transition now becomes the focus of the IEP.  By law, the student must be invited to attend his/her IEP meeting. Although he/she can refuse to attend, parents can not request the student be excused from the meeting. This resource was created by PaTTan and is designed to provide information for youth, families, schools and educators about the student-led IEP process. Students are required to be invited to their IEP meetings starting at age 14 and having the goal of a student being a part of their meeting is a great way to build independence, advocacy, communication, and confidence.

This document outlines the differences between IDEA, ADA and Section 504. It is important for parents/guardians and students to understand that the change from entitlement to eligibility for services occurs once the student leaves the public school system and enters the adult world. This PA site connects individuals with a disability and older Pennsylvanians to services and supports available in their community. CMU offers case management, funding, and access to community resources for children and adults with mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Click ""CMU Services"" then ""Intake"" for directions on how to open a case. OVR offers eligible students with disabilities vocational guidance and assistance in preparing for, obtaining, or maintaining competitive employment.  Referrals can be made by the school with parent permission, the parent, or the student him/herself. After going through the intake process and having an open case, meetings with your OVR counselor can be held at the school during the school day.",478
