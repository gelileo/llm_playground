Second Step (Social Emotional Learning & Bullying Prevention Curriculum)




Second Step Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Curriculum

Second Step: Developed by the Committee for Children www.cfchildren.org 
  Second Step Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) gives students the tools to excel in and out of the classroom. Our easy-to-teach program garners outstanding reviews from educators who’ve noticed school-wide improvement and see even the most challenging students make progress in emotion management, situational awareness, and academic achievement. In classrooms from Kindergarten through grade 5, students learn invaluable skills that help them navigate their way through school as well as their community. Second Step’s age-appropriate games, activities, and media engage students and set children on a path to lifelong success. Second Step SEL has been successfully implemented by over 26,000 schools worldwide. The curriculum is designed to align with district standards. Students eagerly anticipate Second Step’s fun, captivating lessons that include games, activities, and songs. The skills they learn are useful in school, on the playground, and at home. Second Step has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) and the Department of Education, for the quality of our research, training, and teacher and family support.
Second Step Bullying Prevention Curriculum

It’s never too early to provide students and staff with tools to prevent bullying, both in school and in the community. Based on the latest field research, Second Step’s Bullying Prevention curriculum teaches Kindergarten–Grade 5 students how to recognize, report, and refuse bullying. As students master these crucial skills, educators and school staff learn to recognize and respond appropriately when they observe bullying or receive a bullying report, all while gaining insight into teaching the unit to children. Building on the fundamentals of the Second Step Social Emotional Learning Curriculum, the Committee for Children developed the Bullying Prevention Unit with age-appropriate lessons for elementary classrooms (Kindergarten–Grade 5).

Training, lessons, and family resources were developed to put research-based strategies in the hands of educators to create spaces safe for learning.
School staff learn to work with all students involved in bullying, including bystanders, for an improved school climate.
When all staff learn how to recognize and respond to bullying effectively, students understand that they can trust staff to deal with it appropriately.
With the help of acclaimed author Trudy Ludwig, they’ve woven engaging live action and animated videos into every lesson.
Family materials extend lessons beyond the classroom and help families distinguish between peer conflict and bullying.
The Bullying Prevention Unit includes principal resources, staff training, and student lessons to help everyone learn bullying prevention techniques.
