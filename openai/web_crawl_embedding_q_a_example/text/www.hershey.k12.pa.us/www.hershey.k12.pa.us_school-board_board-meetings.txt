Board Meetings





As a convenience for constituents, Derry Township School District Board of School Directors’ business meetings are made available via online livestream. In addition to being able to view the meeting in real time, online attendees also have the same opportunity to participate in public comment as those in-person.  Pre-registration is required.
Board meetings are open to the public and are primarily held on the second and fourth Monday of each month at 7 p.m. in the Derry Township School District Office at 30 East Granada Avenue, Hershey. Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed.

Agendas
School Board meeting agendas can be accessed through the Derry Township School District's AgendaManager site.  Meetings proceed based on an agenda that follows guidelines established in the Pennsylvania School Code. The district administration and school board members recommend agenda items. The board president, elected by fellow directors, presides at all meetings. The vice president presides in the president’s absence.
AgendaManager Board Meeting Agendas
Public Comment at Board Meeting
The School Board benefits from comments and questions raised by visitors at board meetings. Those who wish to address the board can do so at two designated places on the agenda. At the appropriate time, the visitor should rise, step to the microphone, and pronounce his/her name clearly for the Board Secretary to record. Visitors no longer need to state their address for the record out loud during public comment. We ask that they complete an address card if attending in person or submit their address if attending via zoom. School Directors and the Superintendent may ask questions or make responding comments. Visitor remarks should be limited to five minutes or less. The president reserves the right to limit discussion whenever he or she deems it appropriate to maintain proper conduct.
Minutes and Recordings
Consistent with Pennsylvania state laws regarding public meetings and open records, the Derry Township School District maintains minutes of the official actions taken by the Board of School Directors. For the convenience of its constituents, the district posts copies of the official minutes here. Minutes are not official until approved by the board; therefore, minutes are not posted until such time as they have been voted upon and made official - typically at the subsequent board meeting.

Beginning with the 2012-13 School Year, the Derry Township Board of School Directors also posts digital audio files from its public meetings. While the recordings may be used in the preparation of minutes, they do not substitute for official, legally approved minutes.
