Comprehensive Plan




The Pennsylvania Department of Education requires every school district in the Commonwealth to develop and submit a comprehensive plan every six years. The comprehensive plan acts as a road map – giving clarity, unity, and direction to the district’s efforts. Opportunities to create, assess, and adjust throughout the cycle empowers local education agencies and schools to engage all stakeholders in pursuit of a shared vision for student success.

The comprehensive plan is the vehicle for defining and addressing the district's most critical educational issues. For example, the Derry Township School District must meet the tremendous challenges and opportunities in implementing state curriculum regulations that focus on student learning standards. In addition, the district must focus on preparing its students for the societal, educational, and economic opportunities of the 21st Century.
