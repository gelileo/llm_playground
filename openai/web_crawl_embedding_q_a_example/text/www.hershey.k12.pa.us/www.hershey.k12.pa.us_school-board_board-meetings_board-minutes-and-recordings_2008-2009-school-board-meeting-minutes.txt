2008-2009 School Board Meeting Minutes






Board of School Directors Meetings 2008-2009
Consistent with Pennsylvania state laws regarding public meetings and open records, the Derry Township School District maintains minutes of the official actions taken by the Board of School Directors. For the convenience of its constituents, the district posts copies of the official minutes here. Minutes are not official until approved by the board; therefore minutes are not posted until such time as they have been voted upon - typically at the subsequent board meeting.
