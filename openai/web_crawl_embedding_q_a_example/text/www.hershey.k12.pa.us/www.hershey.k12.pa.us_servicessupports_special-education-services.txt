Special Education Services




Welcome to the Department of Special Education 
We are honored to work with you and your children. At Derry Township, it is our mission to cultivate an extraordinary learning environment that expands the minds and nurtures success for every member of the school community.  Our staff takes an immense amount of pride in the special education services we provide.  You may have questions regarding special education and supports your child is eligible to receive.  Our team looks forward to guiding you through this process.  
Special Education is planned instruction specifically designed to address the educational and related developmental needs of children with disabilities. A plan is designed through a team approach, in which an IEP is developed to enable the student to make progress by addressing their individual needs.  This includes Early Intervention Services for pre-school-age students starting at three, as well as services for school-age children in grades K-12.  
We have several screencasts and resources available on our site. If you have a suggested topic that you feel would be relevant to group, please use the 'contact us' button to send an email to the department mailbox. If you are not receiving our emails, please check ParentVUE to ensure we have the correct email and edit as needed. Send an email using the 'contact us' link below for more assistance. 






Our Vision


Each student with a disability is regarded for their strengths and contributions, participates alongside typically developing peers while fulfilling meaningful roles and does so with the full support of their family and community.

News & Notes


Meetings: We will continue to zoom as our primary medium for IEP and other meetings. Families have expressed appreciation for this option to make it easier for childcare or meetings during the workday. If you would prefer an in-person meeting, let your child’s case manager know.
Email documents: We will use email as the most efficient way to send documents to you. If you prefer that special education documents are sent via U.S. Mail, let your child’s case manager know.
PASA Testing: The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires Pennsylvania to ensure that the total number of students assessed in each subject using the PASA does not exceed 1% of the total number of all students in the state assessed on the statewide assessments. Each local educational agency (LEA) must submit justification to BSE if it anticipates that more than 1.0% of its students enrolled in grades 3-8 and 11 will be assessed using the PASA. A list of LEAs who anticipate exceeding the threshold will be made publicly available on the PDE website, in accordance with 34 CFR 200.6 (c)(3) regulations. LEAs must also make the document publicly available upon request, removing any personally identifiable information. The Derry Township School District anticipates exceeding the 1.0% threshold for PASA participation for the 2023-2024 testing cycle. The necessary justification information has been submitted to the Bureau of Special Education. Questions on the DTSD participation rates should be directed to Kirsten Scheurich, Director of Special Education.
