Transition Resources






Secondary Transition is the process of preparing students with disabilities for life after they leave high school. This includes participation in post-secondary education or training, employment, and independent community living. These three areas are the driving force behind every IEP (Individualized Education Program) for students with disabilities ages 14+ in Pennsylvania.

Planning for the Future Checklist





Planning for the Future Checklist
Created by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the purpose of this checklist is to empower and enable students with disabilities and their families in planning for life beyond high school.

 






Secondary Transition - What Families Need to Know





Secondary Transition - What Families Need to Know
Transition planning is a process required by federal and state law. Any student who will be turning 14 during the duration of the IEP must begin the transition planning process; transition now becomes the focus of the IEP.  By law, the student must be invited to attend his/her IEP meeting. Although he/she can refuse to attend, parents can not request the student be excused from the meeting.

 






Student-Led IEPs





Student-Led IEPs
This resource was created by PaTTan and is designed to provide information for youth, families, schools and educators about the student-led IEP process. Students are required to be invited to their IEP meetings starting at age 14 and having the goal of a student being a part of their meeting is a great way to build independence, advocacy, communication, and confidence.
