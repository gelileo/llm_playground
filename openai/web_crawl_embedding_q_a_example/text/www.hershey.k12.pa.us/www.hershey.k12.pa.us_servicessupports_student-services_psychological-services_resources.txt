With the current emphasis on nationwide accountability and outcome data, schools are gradually becoming more scientific. Consequently, practitioners need to adopt a defensible methodology for selecting evidence-based educational interventions to solve common academic and social behavior problems. Specifically, a framework is needed for the selection of functionally relevant, evidence-based interventions. The most defensible methodology for intervention selection is to adopt a functional approach to understanding academic and social behavior problems. Using this approach, all incorporated interventions are selected based on evidence that they provide a logical solution to the problem at hand.
The EBI Network has been developed to provide guidance in the selection and implementation of evidence-based interventions in the classroom setting. There are four general categories of resources on the EBI Network:
1. Evidence-Based Intervention Resources
2. Response to Intervention Resources
3. English Language Learners Resources
4. Foundations of Problem Solving Resources
Evidenced Based Intervention Network - University of Missouri
What works in education? The Best Evidence Encyclopedia (BEE) presents reliable, unbiased reviews of research-proven educational programs to help:

Policy Makers use evidence to make informed choices.
Principals choose proven programs to meet state standards.
Teachers use the most powerful tools available.
Researchers find rigorous evaluations of educational programs.   

Best Evidence Encyclopedia - Johns Hopkins School of Education
Intensive intervention (both academic interventions and behavior interventions) is intended to help these students. The Center's approach to intensive interventions is data-based individualization (DBI). DBI uses data to individualize instruction, increase engagement, and provide opportunities to practice new skills. Within multi-tiered systems of support such as RTI or PBIS, this is often considered Tier III. Learn more about the DBI Framework, meet Center Staff, visit the Tools Charts to find evidence-based progress monitoring tools or interventions, and view the DBI Training Series to find professional development materials to support the implementation of DBI in schools and districts.
National Center on Intensive Intervention 
The Promising Practices Network (PPN) website is a unique resource that offers credible, research-based information on what works to improve the lives of children and families.
Sometimes referred to as a "best practices" site or a "model program" site, PPN is both of those things and much more. In addition to providing summaries of effective programs in our Programs that Work section, PPN also features Issue Briefs that summarize the current research on various topics, as well as Expert Perspectives, where child policy experts answer our visitors' most pressing questions on a variety of topics. PPN also links to additional research information in all areas related to child well-being, including their physical and mental health, academic success, and economic security. To promote successful implementation of best practices and model programs, PPN also screens and posts evidence-based information on effective Service Delivery.
In addition to the breadth of information PPN provides, visitors can rely on PPN to provide information that has met our high standards for scientific credibility, objectivity, and clarity. Learn about our process for reviewing information for inclusion on the site and how to submit a program for consideration.

This video was developed by the Response to Intervention Training Project at Lehigh University, a U.S. Department of Education funded personnel preparation grant, to provide information about working with English Language Learners (ELL) within a Response to Instruction and Intervention (RTII) model, particularly in reading. Visit http://www.lehigh.edu/education/rti/ for more information on the project and links to other RTI-related instructional videos.
English Language Learners within a Response to Instruction and Intervention Model 
This video was developed by the Response to Intervention Training Project at Lehigh University, a U.S. Department of Education funded personnel preparation grant, to guide and understand the process and importance of data-based decision making throughout all stages of a Response to Intervention model, specifically in reading. It presents four phases of the data-based decision making process: 1) Universal Screening and Pre-meeting Preparation, 2) Core Team Meetings, 3) Grade-level Team Meetings, and 4) Process Outcomes.
Response to Intervention - Data Based Decision Making
This video is a description of the Response-to-Intervention (RTI) process as implemented through Project MP3: Monitoring Progress of Pennsylvania Pupils, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The video was produced by the Center for Promoting Research to Practice at Lehigh University, Bethlehem PA, in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Training and Technical Assistance Network. The RTI model illustrated is being implemented in our project and in the state of Pennsylvania.
