Athletics






Overview


Derry Township School District believes that sports not only offer students the opportunity to take part in an activity they enjoy, but also provide students with many lifelong benefits, such as character development, goal-setting, and friendships.

Athletics also teach participants lessons in teamwork, discipline, leadership, and overcoming adversity. As such, the District offers an array of athletic programs for high school and middle school students.

Governance


The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) and the Mid Penn Conference (MPC) govern Derry Township School District’s athletic programs. 
The PIAA is responsible for the overall organization, development, and direction of the interscholastic athletic programs of Pennsylvania while the MPC, which is comprised of 31 central Pennsylvania school districts, is responsible for fostering, developing, and promoting athletic relationships between member schools.






Mike Montedoro - Athletic Director 


Mr. Montedoro started his career in High School Athletics in 1989 and hasn't looked back since.  His role in Athletic Administration began in 1997 as the Assistant Athletic Director in the Gettysburg Area School District.  In 1997, he took over as the Athletic Director at Scotland School for Veteran's Children followed by a brief stint as the Director of Athletics and Facilities in the Susquenita School District before taking over Athletics and Transportation for the Shippensburg Area School District. Mike previously served as the president of the Mid Penn Athletic Conference. Mr. Montedoro is looking forward to learning and expanding his breadth of educational-based athletics in the Derry Township School District.
