Federal Criminal History




Volunteer Certifications: FBI  Criminal History Record
This certification requires individuals to have their fingerprints taken digitally at a registered fingerprinting site. However, before your fingerprints can be taken you must first register for the process.
This can be done by registering online at the IdentoGO Site or by phone at 1-844-321-2101 (Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. – 6 p.m.). There is a $23.25 fee associated with this certification. Payment must be made on site at the fingerprint location with a credit card, money order or cashier’s check payable to MorphoTrust.

Print your service summary information 

Once you have registered, proceed to an approved fingerprinting site to be digitally fingerprinted. Please remember to take the service summary information with you to the fingerprint location.

Shortly after your fingerprints have been taken and a result can be provided, you will receive an email. At this time you will be advised to click on the link within the email and enter your security question and answer. It is important that you download, save and print your results for future needs. The system will not allow a second access to this electronic result.
Unfortunately, after three unsuccessful logins, the system will prevent you from retrieving your results electronically. If you mistakenly lock yourself out of the system your results will be transmitted by US Mail. Current Mailing timelines take 7-10 business days to reach the intended destination.  
After having your fingerprints taken at an approved IndentoGO site, please provide a copy to Human Resources Office. 
If any result has a record associated with it, those results will not be electronically available and can only be transmitted by US Mail.  Please provide your original copy to Human Resources Office.
The FBI Federal Criminal History Record is only valid for five years (60 months) from the date issued. In order to continue volunteering in the District, you must renew your FBI Federal Criminal History Record check every five years from the date of issue.
