Early Dismmisal

Subscribe to Alerts
 

all day
Derry Township School District has made the decision to dismiss school early on April 8, 2024 due to the solar eclipse. An eclipse occurs when the moon partially or totally covers the sun. The April 8th eclipse is scheduled to begin at approximately 2:06 pm, reach its maximum at 3:21 pm and end at approximately 4:33 pm. Due to the timing of the eclipse coinciding with student dismissal at our Primary and Secondary buildings, we will dismiss all students at the times listed below as a precautionary measure for student safety. This day will be an early dismissal regardless of the weather conditions (sunny, cloudy).
High School and Middle School Dismissal: 12:00PM (Lunch will be served)
ECC and Elementary Dismissal: 1:00PM (Lunch will be served)
Athletics schedules have been adjusted to occur after the eclipse event has completed. Athletes should check coaches for more information. Kindergarten Registration will continue as planned for the evening of April 8th. 
The solar eclipse is an excellent educational opportunity for all of our students and families. We will take advantage of this in our classrooms to share more about this amazing scientific and historic event. However, we do want everyone to take extreme caution when viewing the eclipse. While the moon moves across the sun’s bright face, it is dangerous to look directly at it without proper eye protection.
We encourage families to visit NASA’s website at https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/ for more information about solar eclipse safety and ideas for safely viewing the solar eclipse and we ask that you reinforce safety precautions with your students at home.
