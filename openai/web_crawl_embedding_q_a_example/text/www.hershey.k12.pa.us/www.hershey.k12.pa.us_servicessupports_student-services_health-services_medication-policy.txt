Medication Policy




The Derry Township School District recommends parents administer medications at home, but it realizes some children need medication at school.  In those instances, the following guidelines apply.
The use of medications, both prescription and nonprescription (also known as over-the-counter), must be in strict accord with School District policy.  The school nurse, another licensed person delegated by the nurse, or the student’s parents, with no exceptions, must administer all medication, prescription or nonprescription.
For all medication, a current written order from the licensed prescriber is required.  In some circumstances, the District will accept a verbal order by a licensed prescriber, to be followed by a written order within twenty-four (24) hours.  This should include the name of the child, date of prescription, name of the medication, dosage, and route of administration, specific time or special circumstances under which the medication shall be administered, and signature of the prescriber.  E-mails are not acceptable.
All prescription medicine must be in the original container and labeled with the child's name, medication name, dosage, time, and route of administration.  Ask the pharmacist for a "school bottle" with a complete label and the amount of medication that will be needed at school.  Nonprescription or over-the-counter medication must be in the original, unopened bottle with a readable label.
When a medication order is received, a medication card may be sent home with the student to be signed by the child's parent and returned to the school nurse the following day. Parent signature allows the district to comply with the written medication order.  No emails will be accepted as permission.
Medications, permitted by standing order from the school physician (antibiotic ointment, hydrocortisone, etc.) or by parent signature (pain and fever meds) on the blue Emergency Card, may be administered by the school nurse.
No prescription or nonprescription medications may be in a student’s possession at any time, with the exception of asthma inhalers and epinephrine auto-injectors, which require medical and parent permission.  The School District medication policy provides specific procedures for students to follow regarding delivery to school and storage of medications, both prescription and nonprescription.  Immediately on arrival to school, students must bring all prescription or nonprescription medication to the school nurse.  Verification of the medication and count will be completed and documented at that time. The parent will be notified if there is a discrepancy in the medication or count.
All prescription and nonprescription medication orders expire at the end of the school year and parents are asked to pick up the remaining doses. Medications that are not controlled substances, may be sent home with the student at the written request of the parent.  Medications that are not picked up within one day of the end of the school year will be discarded and documented.
Board policy for medication-210 Use of medications
Board policy for possession of asthma medication-210.2
