Elementary School Project






Derry Township School District has undertaken district-wide feasibility studies of the School District’s existing facilities with a particular focus on the School District’s Elementary School and Early Childhood Center. The feasibility studies involved an evaluation of site and building conditions, educational programs, teaching methods, educational goals and enrollment capacities, present and projected, for the School District.
As a result of the feasibility studies conducted, we have identified a number of issues with the existing Elementary School and Early Childhood Center and their impact on the educational program and goals of the School District. 
Existing building deficiencies include:

Lack of required educational spaces
undersized assembly/share core spaces - gymnasium, cafeteria, music, art, library
no separation of assembly and academic spaces
no learning communities
no integration of student collaboration and breakout spaces - SGIs, LGIs and open collaboration 
lack of faculty planning and support
no "wayfinding" due to long corridors 
limited outdoor play areas
remote parking from main entrance
code and accessibility compliance
general building systems condition and required maintenance 

Based upon a detailed review of several factors, including general building/educational rating, site condition, architectural building condition and systems condition, the studies have concluded that “heavy renovations or alterations are needed” for the Early Childhood Center, and for the Elementary School, “heavy renovations or discontinued use or demolition” should be seriously considered.
