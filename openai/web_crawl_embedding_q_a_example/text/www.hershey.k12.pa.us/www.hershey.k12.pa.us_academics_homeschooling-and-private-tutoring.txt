Homeschooling and Private Tutoring




The decision to have a home education program (22 Pa. Code § 11.31a) or a private tutoring program ( 22 Pa. Code § 11.31(b)(1)) is a right; school district permission is not needed to commence either program, as long as the required documentation is submitted. More information about home education and private tutoring programs can be found on the Pennsylvania Department of Education's Home Education and Private Tutoring website.
Home Education Program (Homeschooling)
Home Education Programs
DTSD Policy 137
Extracurricular Participation by Home Education Students
DTSD Policy 137.1 
Home education programs (also known as homeschooling) are programs where the education of the student is directed by the parent or guardian or such person having legal custody of the child or children.
Restrictions include:

The supervisor of the home education program must have a high school diploma or its equivalent.
All adults living in the home and persons having legal custody of a child or children must not have been convicted of the criminal offenses itemized in 24 Pa. Code § 1-111(e).

Affidavit – Beginning a Home Education Program
The notarized affidavit and objectives, and immunization records must be submitted to Derry Township School District, Administrative Office for the Home Education Program to begin. This affidavit should be submitted by August 1st of each year (24 Pa. Code § 13-1327.1(b)(1)).  Without this documentation, the home education program would not be authorized.
Affidavit - Elementary
Affidavit - Secondary
Evaluation - Completing the Home Education year
An appropriate education is defined as “a program consisting of instruction in the required subjects for the time required in this act and in which the student demonstrates sustained progress in the overall program.” The portfolio evaluation certifies whether an appropriate education occurred.

What: A written evaluation by a qualified evaluator must be submitted for each student. See the Home Education Evaluators section regarding a qualified evaluator.
Who: The evaluation must be submitted by the home education supervisor to the DTSD District Office
When: The evaluation must be submitted by June 30th of each year.
Basis: The evaluation must consist of a portfolio review and interview with the student.
Contents: The evaluation must certify whether an appropriate education is occurring for that student.
Law: See 24 Pa. Code § 13-1327.1(e).(h.1).

Compulsory School Age
All children from the age of six (6) through the age of eighteen (18) must comply with compulsory school attendance requirements. To meet these requirements, parents must ensure that their child between the ages of 6 and 18 is attending or participating in one of the following: a public elementary, middle, or high school; a public charter or cyber-charter school; a private licensed academic or private religious school; home tutoring by a certified teacher; or an approved program of home schooling.




Private Tutoring
Private tutoring is another option for satisfying compulsory school attendance requirements. For families interested in hiring a private tutor (PA certified teacher) rather than having a parent-directed education for their children, we include a section in this guide on Private Tutoring Programs, along with the related laws and regulations. A parent or guardian may act as a private tutor for their own children if they are a PA certified teacher. Background checks and other regulations apply.
