Our District




Derry Township School District is an award-winning public school system located in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  Our community enjoys a legacy that began with founder Milton S. Hershey.  The district serves approximately 3,300 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade residing in Derry Township, Dauphin County. 

Hershey Elementary School - Home to our students in Grades K-5, including the Early Childhood Center - a special space for our youngest learners. Hershey Elementary School is a 2021 National Blue Ribbon School.
Hershey Middle School - Home to students in Grades 6-8, Hershey Middle School is the cornerstone of the district, facilitating student transition from a self-contained elementary school setting to a dynamic high school curriculum.
Hershey High School - Home for students in Grades 9-12, Hershey High School is consistently ranked among the top public high schools in Pennsylvania and the nation.       

Derry Township School District is also a member district of the Dauphin County Technical School.
All of our schools have exemplary facilities, curriculum, faculty, administrators, co-curricular and extra-curricular programs. Annually, more than 90% of our graduating seniors pursue post-secondary education. Hershey High School has also been recognized as one of the top public schools in America by different national publications.  At all assessed grade levels, statewide assessment scores are consistently well above state and national averages. Our collective goal is to be a model for how public education should - and can - function.

We cultivate an extraordinary learning environment - for every child, every day.





Future Ready PA Index
The PA Department of Education has launched its new “Future Ready PA Index” with a dashboard that allows for a look at how Pennsylvania schools – including those here in DTSD - are educating students. In addition to proficiency, the dashboard illustrates growth, achievement, and other data by student groups - such as economically disadvantaged students, English Learners, students receiving special education services, and racial and ethnic groups.
The Future Ready dashboard is searchable by district, school, career, and technical center, or location; and it includes basic information and demographic data for each school.
