Superintendent's Profile





We are proud of our outstanding district and the excellent programming that is offered in our schools. From our full-day kindergarten program to our high-quality courses at the high school, our academic programs are among the best in the state and in the nation. Our vast array of co-curricular and extra-curricular opportunities provide students with a multitude
of ways to be involved in the school and greater community. Our programs are housed within the five buildings on our school campus. Our Early Childhood Center is where you will find our Kindergarten and First Grade students enjoying their first school experience. Grades 2 - 5 can be found in the connecting Primary and Intermediate buildings. In all, we educate over 1400 elementary students each year! Hershey Middle School is the Keystone of the district, creating a bridge of academic growth and social-emotional support as students enter adolescence. Our High School, an Apple Distinguished School and top 25 School in U.S. News & World Report offers diverse and rigorous programming to prepare students to be global leaders and citizens and strong community contributors. Service, career exploration, and strong college and career exploration are all valued and emphasized at Hershey High School. Derry Township School District experiences educational excellence in all of its schools, with student achievement recognition occurring at the state and national levels. Our success as a district exemplifies the strong support for our students from staff, parents, and the local community.
We are committed to the continued improvement of our schools, and welcome ongoing open communication with families and the community. The feedback we receive contributes to our continuous cycle of improvement, bringing the district ever closer to the attainment of strategic Comprehensive Plan goals. Our vision and Comprehensive Plan sets the direction for educational programming and guides the decision-making processes within the organization. The district is steadfast in the work toward achievement of the three Comprehensive Plan goals:

The District will establish systems, structures and supports to ensure all students are provided with opportunities to grow in self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness and relationship skills;
The district will establish systems and structures that allow for the maximization of time within the school day ensuring that teachers have the opportunity to continue to build a collaborative culture of continuous learning, spend individual time with students, and expand their knowledge of relevant content to enhance student learning experiences;
The District will continue to review and refine communication systems and pathways to ensure clarity, ease of access and open lines of communication for all stakeholders.

We embrace the core elements of the COCOA Principles to provide a learning environment that supports the whole child; helping students to reach high levels of academic success and centering social and emotional well-being. My goal for the district is that every student who walks through our doors knows that they are welcomed, respected, valued and loved.
Derry Township School District is a leader in high-quality education. I am honored at the opportunity to lead the district into future years of strong community, rigorous learning and innovation. Together, as a team, we will do great things for students.
Sincerely,
Stacy L. Winslow, Ed.D.
