2013-2014 School Board Meeting Minutes







Board of School Directors Meetings 2013-2014
Consistent with Pennsylvania state laws regarding public meetings and open records, the Derry Township School District maintains minutes of the official actions taken by the Board of School Directors. For the convenience of its constituents, the district posts copies of the official minutes here. Minutes are not official until approved by the board; therefore minutes are not posted until such time as they have been voted upon - typically at the subsequent board meeting.
Beginning with the 2012-13 School Year, the Derry Township Board of School Directors also posts digital audio files from its public meetings.  While the recordings may be used in the preparation of minutes, they do not substitute for official, legally approved minutes.  (Note:  Audio files will open in a new browser window.  Due to the large size of these files, expect lengthy download times.)
Audio recording transcriptions are upon request. To request a copy of a board meeting or committee meeting transcription, please contact skarpel@hershey.k12.pa.us with the meeting date and time.
