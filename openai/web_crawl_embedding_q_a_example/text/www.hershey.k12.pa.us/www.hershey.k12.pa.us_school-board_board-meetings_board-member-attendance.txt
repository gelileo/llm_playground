Board Member Attendance




School Board members are public officials elected to represent a defined constituency.  Since Derry Township School District is a relatively small, single-municipality school district, all board members are considered “at large” members - that is to say every board member represents all residents and taxpayers in the entire school district. (As compared to some school districts where seats on the board are assigned to geo-political sub-divisions such as wards or municipal borders.)
In order to keep its constituents informed about how they are being represented, the Derry Township Board of School Directors has decided to regularly post a report indicating the frequency with which board members attend and participate in the board’s business (“voting”) meetings.  The figures shown for each board member represent the percentage of time that board member was able to be in attendance for meetings held during the reporting period.  Attendance at individual board meetings is reflected in the official minutes for each board meeting.
