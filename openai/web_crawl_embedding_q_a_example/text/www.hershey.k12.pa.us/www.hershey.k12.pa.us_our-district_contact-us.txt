Questions, Comments and Concerns




Derry Township School District believes effective collaboration among home, community, and school is essential. The district encourages all constituents - parents and guardians, community members, and local businesses - to communicate with us regarding district operations. Anonymous submissions or those made under a pseudonym cannot be addressed.
When a question or concern occurs, the first step is to communicate at the local school or department level. If you would like to ask a question or share a concern about your child, speak to your child's teacher first. (Inquiries initially directed to administrators or school board members will be referred to the local level.) Search our Online Staff Directory to find direct contact information for staff. Making direct contact with the appropriate staff member typically ensures the fastest response. For more information about who to contact for your specific question or concern please visit our chain of command matrix here.

Safe2Say Something
All schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including Derry Township School District, have adopted use of the “Safe2Say Something” anonymous tip line as a means of improving campus safety and improving school climate. The tip line is operated and monitored 24/7 by the Office of the Attorney General where tips are reviewed, classified, and forwarded to the appropriate school district. Tips that are found to contain information that may indicate a "life safety" issue are prioritized and immediately forwarded to the appropriate county emergency dispatch center.
Students, parents, and community members can submit tips via three methods:

Online
By calling 1-844-SAF2SAY (1-844-723-2729)
A free mobile application available for Apple and Android devices
