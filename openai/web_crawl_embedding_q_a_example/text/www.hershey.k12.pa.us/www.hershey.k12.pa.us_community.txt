Community




Derry Township is a community cultivating an extraordinary learning environment. This section of the Derry Township School District website is intended to provide information about opportunities and programs that may be of interest to community members, such as volunteer opportunities or how to request the use of district facilities. In addition, this area can also be used to connect current students and their families with community activities and events which may help enrich or expand educational opportunities outside the classroom setting.

Use of School Facilities


Derry Township School District may permit community organizations to use district buildings or grounds for approved special events. Inquiries or requests to use district facilities must be made through the Buildings and Grounds Office. The district will process requests on a first-come, first-served basis, except that school groups will be given priority over external groups.
Facilities Use Request Information




Use of DTSD Athletic Tracks


Derry Township School District’s campus includes two running tracks: a cinder track adjacent to Hershey Elementary School and a gated all-weather track at Hershey High School. Community members wishing to exercise on Derry Township School District-owned running tracks may do so between dawn and dusk when the facilities are not being utilized for school-related activities.
While our campus offers great surroundings for dog walks, exercises, and leisurely strolls, it's crucial to remember that our primary focus is always on providing a safe and conducive learning environment for our students. With classes often held outside and various school activities taking place throughout the day, it's essential that our students have uninterrupted access to school facilities and grounds during school hours.
We kindly ask that community members refrain from using our campus for recreational activities during school hours, especially around areas where classes are conducted outdoors. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated and goes a long way in ensuring the safety and well-being of our students.
Several special provisions apply to the use of the high school track:

The use of the synthetic turf playing surface is prohibited.
The following items are not permitted inside the fencing surrounding the track.
	
Food
Gum
Pets
Seeds
