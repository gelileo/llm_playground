Hershey Intervention & Prevention Program (HIP)





The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Student Assistance Program (SAP), is overseen by the PA Network for Student Assistance Services (PNSAS) Interagency and Regional Coordinators’ team; comprised of representation from the PA Departments of Education (Safe Schools Office), Drug and Alcohol Programs (Division of Prevention and Intervention) and Human Services (Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services). The Pennsylvania Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a systematic team process used to mobilize school resources to remove barriers to learning.

Second Step Program






Bullying Prevention





In an effort to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for all students, Derry Township School District believes bullying is an unacceptable behavior that adults and students have a responsibility to stop. The District recognizes that bullying creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, detracts from the safe environment necessary for student learning, and may lead to more serious violence. Therefore, the District prohibits bullying of any kind. The Pennsylvania Department of Education’s Office for Safe Schools has implemented the PA Bullying Prevention Consultation Line. The Bullying Prevention Consultation Line is a toll-free number to allow individuals experiencing chronic and unresolved bullying to discuss effective strategies and available resources to deal with school-based bullying. This supportive resource has been developed in collaboration with the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (CHPDP), and is available at no cost to students, parents/guardians, and school districts across the state. Users can leave a message 24 hour a day, seven days a week, and will be returned Monday-Friday during normal business hours. The Consultation Line number is 1-866-716-0424.
