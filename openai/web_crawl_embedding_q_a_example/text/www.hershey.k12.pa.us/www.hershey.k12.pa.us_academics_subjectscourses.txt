The curriculum provides learning for grades 9 through 12 with courses that will help each and every student, regardless of their personal interests, to become more aware of how business and finance plays a role in their lives. 
Each student has the opportunity to engage in a plethora of courses that will test their business skills (Accounting I, Sports and Entertainment Marketing, Entrepreneurship) finance skills (Accounting II, Accounting III, Consumer Topics/Money Management), as well as their computer skills (Keyboarding, College-Bound Word Processing, Technology Applications).  These courses are designed to introduce the core business fundamentals and build a solid foundation for future business growth and financial literacy.  Also, these courses use technology and 21st Century skills to implement several key business processes that allows each learner to grow to develop the necessary skills to become a successful business leader.






English/Language Arts





High School 
The goal of the English program at Hershey High School is to develop students who are both effective communicators and critical consumers of a variety of texts to prepare them for success in our increasingly complex, information-driven society. Over the course of four years, students will acquire and refine specific skills and strategies in reading, writing, speaking, and listening.

Derry Township School District requires that students complete four (4) credits of English to fulfill graduation requirements.
In ninth grade, students are required to take a year-long, one-credit English course. There are three academic placement levels, including fundamental, college preparatory and honors.
In tenth grade, students again are required to take a year-long, one-credit English course. There are three academic placement levels, including fundamental, college preparatory and honors. In addition, students must also complete Academic Literacy, a semester-long course meeting every other day, for one quarter credit.
During the eleventh grade year, students have a variety of options, depending on academic level. The fundamental English 11 course is a full-year, one-credit course. At the college preparatory level, students choose two semester-long, half-credit courses from various thematic concentrations; however, despite the different content, all of these courses help students develop the same skills. The courses include Great Books, Media Studies, Hero’s Journey and Multicultural Literature. More advanced students who are ready for college-level work may take AP English Language and Composition, a year-long, one-credit course.

The twelfth grade year is structured similarly to the eleventh grade year. The fundamental English 12 students take two semester-long, half-credit courses: Communications and Contemporary Literature. At the college preparatory level, students choose two semester-long, half-credit courses from options including Creative Nonfiction, Film Studies, Words that Change the World, and Science Fiction Literature. Advanced students may take AP English Literature and Composition, a year-long, one-credit course.

High School Major Literary Works




Middle School
The goal of the English Language Arts department at Hershey Middle School is to develop critical thinkers, effective communicators, analytical readers, and informed consumers of media.
In eighth grade English Language Arts, students are provided with opportunities and resources to develop their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.  These skills are essential to a student’s ability to be informed and productive members in our society. Throughout the year, students will read a variety of high-quality fiction and nonfiction texts including but not limited to poetry, mythology, plays, articles, and novels. Classroom instruction will include strategies, techniques, and procedures for helping students develop as readers and writers.  The instruction advocates techniques for students to become analytical readers and effective communicators, and students will have multiple opportunities to practice these techniques throughout the school year. All skills are taught through thematic units; currently, the thematic units in eighth grade include Building Bridges; Our Odyssey, Our Journey; and Stirring Up Justice.
In seventh grade, students use diverse texts to respond critically, interpret messages, and analyze author’s purpose. Beyond learning to use text as evidence to support claims and arguments, students also develop personal reading habits and goals throughout the year as well as participate in literature circles.  Literature circles focus on further exposing students to diverse writers and diverse characters while developing their group discussion skills and the use of annotation and text evidence to enhance academic discussion. Writing skills are taught and practiced through the use of mentor texts, mini-lessons on both writing strategies and conventions, and peer editing.
Process, collaboration, and authentic experiences are emphasized throughout each unit.  Seventh grade units include “Your Heroes, Your Imagination”, “Your Relationships, Your Connections”, “Your World, Your Future”, and Your Voice, Your Power."
In sixth grade English Language Arts, students are provided with opportunities and resources to develop their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. The year is split into three units: fiction, nonfiction, and research. Students are taught a variety of reading strategies and skills. The units also include five different types of writing: narrative, informational, argumentative, text dependent analysis, and research. All reading and writing strategies and skills are taught through direct instruction, guided practice, and independent practice. Students are then assessed formatively and differentiation groups are used based on formative assessment scores. Students are then assessed summatively.

ESL - English as a Second Language





The English as a Second Language (ESL) program aims to develop linguistic competency for students, with limited English proficiency, kindergarten through 12th grade. The goal of the program is to provide students with the language skills needed to actively participate in social and academic settings. Support and intensive instruction are provided to enable students to become successful in content classes. ESL instruction correlates to the English Language Proficiency Standards outlined by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Emphasis is placed on the four domains of communication: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. These domains are addressed through Content Based Instruction in an ESL class. Modifications and accommodations are also made in content classes based on an individual student’s level of English proficiency. Completion of the ESL program is based on the exit criteria set forth by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
 






Family and Consumer Science





 
Middle School
Family and Consumer Sciences standards were passed into law, January, 2003.
Family and Consumer Science studies the relationship between individuals, families, and communities and the environment in which they live. It recognizes the importance positive human relationships, good nutrition, and a balanced lifestyle play in the ability of students to come to school ready to learn and to enter the ‘adult’ world ready to fulfill their role as productive citizens and raise strong families.
Family and consumer sciences curriculum supports the knowledge and skills that students need as family members both now and in the future. In addition, it requires all students to investigate and plan for possible careers, develop practical skills for employment, develop financial literacy, manage resources, and practice positive communication skills. Our goal is to take increased responsibility for improving their quality of living and develop the knowledge and skills needed in making choices to meet their personal, family and work responsibilities.
 
FCS speaks to the challenges we face as members of a global society and is delivered in an authentic manner. It lends itself to integration and collaboration with other disciplines. The rigorous curriculum is designed to be authentic, stress teamwork, leadership, and technology. It applies math, science, and communication skills to everyday living.

Library





The Derry Township School District’s libraries support the district’s mission of “Engaging all students every day to help them achieve their greatest potential as global citizens“ and serve as an integral part of the instructional program by providing the school community with the best resources and services.

The Derry Township School District’s library curriculum is designed to empower students to accomplish the following: consume information critically, enhance their love of literature and reading, research skillfully, and use information ethically and productively.  With heightened demands for critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration, our learners must develop relevant skills to succeed in our information-rich society.  All learners must be able to access high-quality information from diverse perspectives, make sense of it to draw their own conclusions or create new knowledge, and share their knowledge with others.

The curriculum framework is standards-based and built upon the Model Curriculum for Pennsylvania School Library Programs, which draws on the PA Core Standards, the American Association of School Librarian’s Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, and ISTE Standards.  It is designed to vertically articulate information literacy across the grades from kindergarten through grade twelve.  The focus is on a sequential and broad set of information and technology skills and performance standards that are necessary for academic achievement.

At the elementary level, students have a regularly scheduled library class. At the secondary level, skills are embedded in curricular objectives from various disciplines since a collaborative approach to teaching the standards is most effective in the context of content learning.






Mathematics





 
High School 
Hershey High School provides a standards-aligned approach to mathematics that emphasizes higher-order thinking and exposure to authentic, real-world content. Throughout the program, students are given opportunities to investigate, hypothesize and discover mathematical phenomena. Though most students complete four years of mathematics at the high school level, students must complete a minimum of three courses. Our core mathematics courses lead to Advanced Placement Courses in Calculus and then to Advanced Calculus. Our elective courses include Statistics and Advanced Placement Statistics as well as a trio of programming courses including Advanced Placement Computer Science.
Middle School
Our school district mission statement asks that we have an education system that engages all students every day to help them achieve their greatest potential as global citizens. This is the goal of the Derry Township and Hershey Middle School mathematics programs. Our program was designed around two central themes: to provide a curriculum centered around Pennsylvania Common Core standards as well as allowing students to maximize individual potential. The curriculum used is based on the College Preparatory Math program also known as CPM. Students begin in sixth grade taking one of two courses: either CC1 or an accelerated course, called CC1.5, that covers one and a half years of curriculum in a one-year setting. Several metrics are used to determine the placement of students in seventh grade. Students are enrolled either in CC2, CC2.5, or CC Algebra. Based upon satisfactory completion of courses in seventh grade, students may be enrolled in CC3, CC Algebra or CC Geometry in the eighth grade. All three years of courses focus on developmentally appropriate progressions through statistics, probability, algebraic concepts, geometry, measurement and numeric operations. This is done in a setting where problem-solving and logical thinking is central to instruction. The focus of all middle school courses is in line with what Pennsylvania Common Core states: that is to have "middle school standards call on students to practice applying mathematical ways of thinking to real-world issues and challenges. They prepare students to think and reason mathematically." Students in all three grade levels take part in PSSA and students enrolled in algebra in the middle school also take the Keystone exam for algebra which is required for graduation.
Elementary School
Derry Township School District’s elementary mathematics curriculum is designed to engage all learners in a rigorous, focused and coherent program that develops mathematical thinking, conceptual understanding, problem-solving, reasoning, fluency, and communication. The curriculum is aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards for Mathematics and includes mastery of both content and practice standards.  A deep understanding of mathematical concepts is built through a progression of concrete, representational and abstract learning experiences that help students become effective, efficient, and flexible problem solvers who can represent and communicate their thinking well






Music





 
Students in the Derry Township School District have many opportunities to learn to create, perform, and appreciate music as an integral part of their education. Our curriculum is closely tied to the National Standards for Music Education and the Pennsylvania standards for the Arts and Humanities.
The Derry Township School District is proud of its music programs, having been named one of the “Best Communities for Music Education” several times. Many students and ensembles have been recognized at the State and Regional level, and our highly-qualified staff regularly guest conducts and presents clinics at local and regional honors ensembles and conferences.
In our elementary schools, students receive comprehensive classroom music education in grades one through five. Students learn to sing, perform, compose, create, movement, folk dance, and experience music through a variety of classroom activities. Additionally, students in grades four and five have the opportunity to participate in our instrumental music program (both band and orchestra) and students in grade five may participate in choir.
Our middle school continues classroom music instruction in grades six, seven, and eight. These classes introduce instrumental performance opportunities through the use of keyboards and guitars, and work to ensure that students are familiar with the ways that music is and can be a joyful and important part of their lives, promoting lifelong learning in the art form. The middle school has active band, choir, and orchestra programs.
Hershey High School offers a variety of leveled ensembles for vocalists, as well as wind, percussion, and string players. Advanced Placement Music Theory is also offered at the high school level.
Each music teacher maintains a Canvas or SeeSaw account to allow access for all students and parents enrolled in music courses. Community members are encouraged to visit the district calendar for a full list of concerts and other music events hosted by Derry Township SD.

Physical Education/Health






The Derry Township School District Health and Physical Education Department is committed to prepare students to live healthy, productive and physically active lives for the 21st Century.

The primary goal of physical education in grades 1-5 is to develop students' fundamental movement skills within a variety of developmentally appropriate activities. The program enhances students' personal fitness and provides them with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in a variety of physical activities. Personal and social responsibility, self-directed learning, and problem solving skills are reinforced throughout the 1-5 physical education curriculum.

The middle school physical education program strives to develop students' personal fitness and skill-related abilities. The program reinforces students' understanding and application of fitness concepts and motor skills through a variety of movement forms. The program aims to develop students' personal and social responsibility, self-management skills, and ability to make informed choices. The overall goal of this program is to enhance students' disposition toward leading a physically active lifestyle.

Pursuit of personal fitness and understanding the benefits of leading a physically active lifestyle is at the core of the high school physical education curriculum. Thus, designing, implementing and assessing personal fitness is the primary goal for the individual student. Refining a variety of movement skills that contribute toward lifelong activity is an essential component of the program.

Health Education is a primary focus of the Derry Township School District.  The purpose of this curriculum is to provide pertinent information that allows the students to make prudent decisions based on factual data.  Students are taught to make positive and healthy life choices through the study of basic psychology, body systems, drug and alcohol awareness, and basic first aid.

The above curricula, Health, Physical Education, is reflective of the Pennsylvania State Standards and is continuously reviewed and revised.






Science






High School
The Derry Township School District’s high school students elect a minimum of three science credits from a suite of academic, honors and advanced placement courses in the physical and life sciences. Students must enroll in at least one biology, one chemistry, and one physics course during their time in high school in order to meet graduation requirements.  The high school program includes core and elective courses at the academic and honors levels and four Advanced Placement courses.
Consistent with all outstanding secondary science programs, our program places great emphasis on laboratory work and the integration of technology into the collection, manipulation and presentation of data. Strategic Plan process targets in technology, communication, critical thinking, working cooperatively, applying problem-solving skills, authentic learning experiences and showing responsibility for learning, are supported by the Science curricula.
Middle School 
Throughout the course of their three years at Hershey Middle School, Derry Township students take a progression of Science courses entitled Science 6, Science 7, and Science 8. These Science courses cover a variety of standards-based content in the Physical and Life Sciences that builds from year to year using spiraling and scaffolding to ensure that concepts are both age and developmentally appropriate.

The sixth grade Science course is designed to be highly engaging and includes instruction in basic Science skills and language that is used by students in grades seven and eight. A wide variety of topics are covered, including Physical Science, Life Science, and Astronomy. The Life Science portion of the sixth-grade curriculum culminates in an end of year, overnight, outdoor field trip to Kenbrook where students get to apply and demonstrate their knowledge of the environment as well as gain an appreciation of their responsibilities as stewards of nature. For many students, the sixth-grade year is the first in which they have Science as a Core area of content and get to experience working with a lab group to complete intensive lab activities, many of which are multiple-day experiences in which they learn how to use Science equipment, follow procedures, and gather and analyze data.

The seventh grade Science course is often the first time students experience content taught by Secondary certified instructors. The content is covered to a deeper level and students are asked to think critically and demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of ways, including lab write-ups, multi-paragraph writing assignments, presentations, research projects, and assessments. Once again, a wide variety of content is taught, building upon concepts covered in sixth grade and elementary school. The main area of emphasis is in the area of Environmental Science and Ecology, along with some Earth Science and Chemistry. Good Science skills and common language continue to be emphasized. The seventh-grade year culminates in a trip to the Philadelphia Zoo where students get to see first-hand many of the organisms studied throughout the year.

The eighth-grade Science course continues to build on the sixth and seventh-grade years. Content emphasis shifts to more Physical and Biological Sciences. Science skills and concepts are taught with a mind to prepare students for their high school science classes, specifically ninth-grade Biology. This preparation is planned in conjunction with the Hershey High School Science Department in an effort to make the students’ transition from middle school Science to high school Science as seamless as possible. Eighth grade Science students also take the Science PSSA, which is a standardized test used to assess what they have learned thus far in their Science education.
 






Social Studies






High School
The Hershey High School Social Studies Department aims to guide students in developing historical thinking skills, geographic and cultural experience and knowledge, and an understanding of the decisive role of critical thought and tolerance as 21st century global citizens.

In 9th grade Civics, students learn how responsible citizens productively engage in a political system.

In 10th grade World History, students learn how the changing relationship between human beings and the physical and natural environment affected human life from early times to the present, why relations among humans been so complex since early times, and how human views of the world, nature, and the cosmos have changed.

In 11th grade American History, students learn what it means to be an American, how Americans have responded to challenges, and how American democracy has failed and succeeded.

From the eleventh grade on, students may also choose to take Money and Power, a course that fuses political science with economics; Law and Society, which fuses law and sociology; and Psychology, in which students investigate the science and study of the human mind.

Advanced Placement classes in the Social Studies Department include AP Human Geography, an intensive study of the history and science of the human inhabitation of the planet; AP US History, an intensive study of all of American history; and AP European History, an intensive study of European history since the High Middle Ages.

Middle School
The sixth grade Social Studies curriculum involves the geography, history and culture of the Western Hemisphere while incorporating the five themes of geography.  The teaching and learning encompasses spatial thinking by using maps of the United States, Canada and Latin America.  Thematic maps of our western world, regions of Canada, and urbanization in Mexico City are all focus areas.  Current events enhance connections students are making through classroom engagement.  Mapping Labs create a hands-on approach in working with physical and political features. The infusion of technology and writing within the units of learning rounds out the sixth grade year.

In seventh grade students study information about cultures around the Eastern Hemisphere then apply the newly acquired knowledge to real and practical situations. The curriculum includes simulations, role-playing, case studies, group activities, writing and research assignments, projects, key concepts of geography and current events. The students will learn the names of places and where they are located, in the process comparing them to our country and others in order to gain a deeper understanding of the people in those places.  Our goal is to impress upon our students the importance of becoming contributing citizens of our society.

In eighth grade, students have a course in American history, American Cultures I.  In this course, we study American history up to and including the Civil War and Reconstruction. The year is broken down into two main topics: 1) the establishment of the government of the United States; and 2) the history of the United States through Reconstruction.






Technology Education






The Technology Education Curriculum is an elective course curriculum, that provides all levels of student learners in grades 9 through 12 with courses that target 21st-century technology initiatives and implements a high degree of STEM/STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) components, as they relate to state and national SAS (state assessment standards).
Students have the opportunity to engage in courses that provide enrichment into the principles of: Engineering & Design, Architectural Design, Energy, Power & Transportation, Engineering Systems (electronic, mechanical systems, robotics, manufacturing), Digital Media & Photography and Manufacturing Technologies.
Students have the advantages of implementing the latest technology tools into these courses, such as advanced CAD (computer-aided design software), 3D printing, CNC/CAM software, EV3 Robotics, etc.  All of these courses have a direct or indirect collaborative connection with relative core subjects and also help students start to develop a pathway to planning for higher education and careers.







World Languages






The Hershey World Language Department supports the District’s mission of engaging all students every day to help them achieve their greatest potential as global citizens through focusing on communicative proficiency within the cultural context of the target language. The Department values proficiency in all five language skills: Listening, speaking, reading, writing and cultural competency. Students are encouraged to continue a long sequence of language study and to incorporate language skills into present and future academic, community and professional endeavors.
In alignment with the American Council of the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages, our World Language program strives to lead students to proficiency in the five areas of the standards: Communication, Culture, Connections, Comparisons and Communities. In our language classes, we promote an awareness of current global and cultural issues and a respect for other cultures and beliefs.
