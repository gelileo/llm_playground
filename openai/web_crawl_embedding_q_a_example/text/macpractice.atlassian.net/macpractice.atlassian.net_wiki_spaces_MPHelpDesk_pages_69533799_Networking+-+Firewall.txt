Due to the unique needs of each office, MacPractice support cannot assist with configuring your office's network. This information is only a recommendation. Your network technician will need this information to configure and secure the current Internal Network to function with MacPractice.To configure your Internal Network to function with MacPractice, start by blocking access from the internet by enabling the router firewall. Block all traffic, then allow incoming traffic selectively to only services required by the office. For example, if an email server is used, open Port 25 for mail.The following tables indicate the network services MacPractice may use. If you do not use a listed ability, the service will not need to be enabled.Firewall IncomingAll incoming services refer to TCP ports. Block all incoming services and enable access to only required services. HIPAA compliancy restricts sending patient data over the internet using unencrypted services.ServiceEncryptedPortFirewallMySQLNo3306Blocked at firewall (use VPN for access)MacPractice Message ServerNo1234Blocked at firewall (use VPN for access)Unencrypted Web ServiceNo80Open only if outside access is required*Encrypted Web ServiceYes443Open only if outside access is required*Server Management AppNo26700Blocked at firewall (use VPN for access)MPXServerNo41853Port 41853 needs to be only used for the MPXServer process, otherwise issues can occur in several areas of MacPracticeIf the MacPractice iPhone/iPad interface or the MacPractice Patient Web interface is used from outside the office,enable access to web services on the firewall and forward these ports to the server's internal IP address.Firewall OutgoingMany Network Administrators will do nothing to block outgoing access. If outgoing access must be enabled, the following services may be enabled for MacPractice to function properly. Only the listed abilities used need to be enabled.ServicePortFirewallDestination HosteClaims SFTP22AllowAnyeClaims PMSFT1023AllowAnyeStatement Transmission22Allowhttp://ftp.pscftpx.com  (for RevSpring)ftp.datamail.biz (for DMA/Capario)Sending Tickets443Allowhttp://tt.macpractice.net NEA FastAttach443Allowsecure1.nea-fast.comMacPractice Drop Box548Allowpublic.macpractice.neteStatement Transmission20,21Allowftp.pscinfogroup.comIn general, wireless access should not be used within your practice for accessing patient data and using MacPractice. Ethernet is more secure and a better choice for a practice. If you do choose to use a wireless access point, it should be secured with WPA2 and a good, long password. Do not use WEP under any circumstances, as it is not secure.
