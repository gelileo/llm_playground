If you don't immediately see a change, be sure to attempt logging out and back in to confirm the new Preferences are loaded.1 How can I access Preferences?2 What are Global and Local Preferences?3 Other MacPractice Configuration Options4 Preferences List4.1 Abilities4.2 Attachments4.3 Claims4.4 Clinical4.5 Clipboard4.6 Coding4.7 Contract Billing4.8 Database Access4.9 Digital Rad.

Below "Update MacPractice..." you'll see "Preferences" listed. What are Global and Local Preferences?This is simply a way to distinguish whether a set of Preferences impacts just the computer that the Preference was adjusted on (Local), or whether it impacts all computers (Global).A few Preferences are User Preferences. User Preferences are tied to the current MacPractice user, and will follow that user from computer to computer.It is important to note that if there was a change to a Global Preference on one computer, any other logged in computers will first need to log out then back in for the change to take effect. We strongly recommend adjusting Global Preferences from the Server computer, as this will ensure those Preferences then carry over.Other MacPractice Configuration OptionsThere are MacPractice Configuration Options that are not included in the Preferences window. These may be set in the ability itself, or as part of setting up References. These settings may be Global or Local. Some configurations are also User-Specific, and will follow you to any computer, based on the MacPractice user login.The following settings are included with the preferences below. Please check the following Preference sections:ToolbarScheduleLedgerClinical TabPerioRestorative ChartingPreferences ListEach Preference category will be listed here, with Global and Local Preferences listed.AbilitiesAbility Preferences allow the user to determine what Abilities are currently purchased on the license.
