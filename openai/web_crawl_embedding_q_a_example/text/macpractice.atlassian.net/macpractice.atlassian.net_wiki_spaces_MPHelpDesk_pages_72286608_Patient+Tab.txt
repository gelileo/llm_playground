Patient InformationThese fields will be used to record additional patient information. A majority of this information can be pulled into Forms, Reports, and Claims. None of these fields are required upon creation of the account, which allows users to enter referrals with names only.Birth Date and AgeEnter the Patient's Birth Date and the Age is automatically calculated on the right. The patient's age will also display in the Patient Selector above the sidebar on the left.

If your office prefers metric units, update the Localization Preferences to Kilograms.Once entered, this information will not pull into a claim form unless customized.SexEnter the Patient’s Gender here. Offices may choose to set this up as a default if it applies to the specialty. The gender here is reflected in the Patient Selector.This information will pull into Box 3 on the CMS Claim Form, Box 22 on the ADA Claim Form, and Box 11 on the UB Claim Form. Unless customized to do so, the Patient's gender does not pull onto the CDA Claim Form. HIE Consent CheckboxThe HIE Consent checkbox ensures that items from HL7 and Labs are able to be transmitted for the Patient. This is normally done when the office needs to upload patient information to a Health Information Exchange for MIPS/MACRA Certification purposes, but can also apply to other HL7 or Labs communications.If it does not apply to your office or you're unsure, leave this unchecked.If you are interested in learning more, a MacPractice representative may help with setting up HL7 or Attachments transmitted via HIE.Social Security Number*Canadian Claim Fields Checked: ID, ID Expiration*By default, the Social Security Number field will display on the Patient tab. Enter the Social Security Numbers without dashes; MacPractice will auto-format this field.With Canadian and International claims, the Medicare or ID can be turned on in lieu of the Social Security Number field. Visit the Preferences > Localization > and change the SSN/Medicare drop down menu to your preferred choice.This information does not pull onto the CMS, ADA, CDA, or UB Claim Forms.Provider and OfficeThe Patient Provider is usually listed as the provider the patient sees most often. This provider will be used by default for most new records created for that patient, such as new charges, appointments, prescriptions, and forms.This can always be changed on the fly in the event the patient sees another provider for a single visit. If the office changes the provide often, feel free to leave the Provider field set to "None" and update records as they are created.If an office has multiple office references, a default office can be set for a patient as well. As with the provider, change this is on the fly during the patient's visit if they are visiting a different location. This office will pull into most new records created for the patient.Chart #The Chart # field is used to keep track of chart identifiers from sources outside of MacPractice. This will often be primary paper chart numbers or numbers from a different system.There is a Preference in Preferences > Patient Ability > Misc. that allows the system to Automatically Assign Chart Numbers and the ability to use a suffix on Chart Numbers. However, usage of this preference is not recommended unless directed by MacPractice.The Chart Number entered here will pull into box Box 3b on the UB Claim Form, but does not pull onto the CMS, ADA, or CDA Claim Forms.Bridge NumberThe Bridge Number is a free type field where patient identifier numbers are stored third party Imaging systems. A MacPractice representative will typically help with the setup of Digital Radiography or Imaging bridges. Leave this field blank in all other cases. Marital StatusIf your offices records marital status information for Patients, select from the available options here. This list is preformatted. You may set the Marital Status in the Default Patient for all new patients as well. This selection does not pull into any of the Claim Forms, unless customized to do so.EmploymentThis pop-up menu is used to record the Patient's employment or student status.Based on the selection made in this menu, "Yes" or "No" will print in Box 10a on the CMS Claim Form.It does not appear this selection pulls into any area of the ADA, CDA, or UB forms, but more information about Employer on the Primary/Secondary tabs will pull into Box 17 on the ADA Claim Form and the Part 2 - Employer area of the CDA Claim Form.Fee ScheduleChoose which Fee Schedule will be used in the Patient's Ledger by default. As with Providers and Offices, this may be changed on the fly as data is entered for the patient visit.If your office only has one Fee Schedule, you may choose to use a Database Utility to update all patients to a specific schedule, or set this as the default in the Default Patient for all new records created. This information does not pull into any of the Claim Forms, unless customized to do so. Preferred LanguageUse this menu to record the patient's primary language. If the desired option is not available in this drop down, additional languages can be turned on in the Languages Reference.The selection made here does not pull into any of the Claim Forms, unless customized to do so. New Patient DateThe New Patient Date is intended to be used as a record of when the patient started to see providers in the office.This date will default to when the patient's record was created in MacPractice, but it can be manually overridden.The New Patient Date is utilized in some reports. However it does not appear on any Claim Forms unless customized to do so.For example, the Patients report in the Marketing node will pull the New Patient Date.Preferred Hygienist*Not present in MacPractice MD, DC or 20/20*Dental practices will have a field for the patient's preferred hygienist. This field is informational, though the Perio charting includes hygienist information. Unless customized to do so, this information will not pull onto any Claim Forms.Relationship to Primary and SecondaryThe Relationship to Primary and Relationship to Secondary fields indicate the connection of the patient to the person listed in the Primary or Secondary tabs.For example, if the patient is a child, and the Primary is their parent, Child would be selected.This field will turn red to notify users of potential issues; if the guarantor and patient names do not match the "Self" status may be incorrect and need corrected. MacPractice does not check fields other than the names and does not check for additional issues if another status is selected. This field is very important for insurance processing and how the subscriber and patient information pulls onto claims. For eClaims, only certain relationships are valid. This information will affect what is pulled into Box 4 and Box 7 as well as what is checked in Box 6 on the CMS Claim Form.In the ADA Claim Form, this selection will pull into Box 10 and Box 18.Then on the CDA Claim Form this will pull into the Part 3 - Patient: Relationship to Employee/Plan Member/Subscriber area of the form. This information will also pull into Box 59 of the UB Claim Form.Recall | Follow-Up Tab*MacPractice MD, DC, and 20/20 will see "Follow-Up". MacPractice DDS will see "Recall".*Recalls and Follow-Ups are built into the MacPractice System to help track when a patient should be returning to the office. The Recall/Follow-Up list will be color coded:Black Text: Not linked to an appointmentGreen Text : Linked to an appointmentRed Text : The connected appointment is scheduled before Recall Date (Last Visit + Frequency)Click the plus sign near the upper right corner of the Recall/Follow-Up table. This will bring up a list of Recall/Follow-Up References. Use the search field and select a record from the list. If the name is not present, use the plus button on the top right to create a new record then enter the Employer information and Address.As with several areas of MacPractice, the columns can be arranged in any order that best fits the office's workflow. Simply click the column header and drag it left or right, then release.TypeThis pulls in the title of the recall as it is entered in the Reference.Last VisitDisplays the date the patient was last seen in your office. This defaults to the date the Recall/Follow-Up was created but may be edited. FrequencyThe length of the Recall/Follow-Up in days. This pulls in from the Reference but is editable. Recall/Follow-Up DateThe date the visit should be due. This number is calculated by adding the Frequency (in days) to the Last Visit date.Next VisitIf the record is not tied to an appointment, this should be the same as the Recall/Follow-Up Date, though it can be manually edited. If the record has been associated to an appointment, the Next Visit date will be the date of the appointment.Appointment DateIf there is no appointment linked, this field will be blank. The recall will also be shown in a black text. If there is an appointment tied the Next Visit & Appointment date will read the same, and the record will show show in a green text.ResourceIf there is an appointment, this column will display the resource (schedule column) it is scheduled under.NotesThis free text field is available for any notes. These notes may pull into letters printed for the patient. They can also automatically delete once the appointment is scheduled if a preference is enabled. Visit our Creating Recalls in the Patient Tab and Scheduling From the Patient Tab tutorial videos for step by step instructions on creating and using Recalls/Follow-Ups. Insurance TabThe Insurance tab is where you can record and review information about the patient's benefits. This tab will list any insurance records associated with the Primary or Secondary person on the account. If you wish to add new insurance to a patient, you must add it through the Primary or Secondary screen; it cannot be added here. However, please keep in mind that the primary insurance does NOT have to be added to the Primary tab. Use this table to determine which insurance is primary, secondary, and so forth for each patient. The insurance at the top is the primary carrier. Click and drag the insurances to place them in the correct order.The columns can also be arranged in any order that best fits the office's workflow. Simply click the column header and drag it left or right, then release.Special InsuranceThe Special Insurance checkbox is not reflected on claims, but is used in some of the Patients By Insurance Carrier report. When checked, this will also add an alert "Special Insurance" when in the Claim Creation Window.Offices generally use this to indicate or remind them that this insurance for the patient has special instructions before submitting the claim.For Example, an insurance may always require paperwork to be filed with the claim for this specific patient.Family Planning*Not present in MacPractice DDS*The Family Planning checkbox will indicate that the patient is undergoing family planning services. Once checked, this will print in Box 24h on the CMS Claim Form. This information does not pull onto the ADA, CDA, or UB Claim Forms.EPSDTThe EPSDT checkbox is the child health component of Medicaid. It's required in every state and is designed to improve the health of low-income children, by financing appropriate and necessary pediatric services.This information will be reported in Box 24h on the CMS Claim Form and Box 1 on the ADA Claim Form. This will not pull into the CDA or UB Claim Forms.Refresh Remaining CoverageClick the Refresh Remaining Coverage button to refresh benefits, based on the insurance coverage used to date, the information entered in the plan, and the renewal date. Please note that if the patient's remaining coverage or deductible amount are overridden, you will not be able to use the Refresh Remaining Coverage button. Refresh Remaining Coverage always uses the plan coverage and deductible amounts to recalculate the patient's coverage, and will not consider any manually overridden amounts.Enabled CheckboxThe Enabled checkbox determines whether or not the coverage is active for the patient. This is most frequently used on multi-patient family accounts. For example, if the mother and children were on insurance held by the mother, and the father used his own insurance, you would uncheck the Enabled checkbox for the father's insurance on the Insurance tab for all other patients on the account. On the father's Insurance tab, the mother's insurance would be unchecked.Much of the insurance data pulls from the primary and secondary tabs, but may be overridden on a per-patient basis.CarrierThis column will display the name of the Insurance Company listed in the Primary/Secondary tabs. The carrier listed first will be considered the Primary Insurance for the patient, regardless of which insurance is listed in the Primary tabs. Subscriber IDThe Subscriber ID lists the patient-specific ID number for the insurance. By default, this will be the same subscriber number that is entered on the Primary or Secondary tab, but it can be changed if necessary.Once you have changed the ID on the Patient tab, the tie is broken. This means updating the information on the Primary tab will not update it on the Patient tab. To re-establish the tie, delete the Subscriber ID from both the Primary and Patient tabs, and save. Once both fields have been saved with a blank value, the tie is re-established.The Subscriber # will pull into Box 1a and Box 9a (if the Patient has multiple insurance coverages) on the CMS Claim Forms. On the ADA Claim Form, this information can pull into Box 8 (if the Patient has multiple insurance coverages) and Box 15.This information also pull into Part 2 - Your Cert. No or S.I.M. or I.D. on the CDA Claim Form. As well as  Box 8a and Box 60 on the UB Claim Form.CopayThe Copay amount can be added to the Copay column within the Insurance sub-tab. This amount will then pull into the charge window. For more information on setting up copays, visit our Helpful Guide - Copay.DeductibleThe Deductible column will pull information from the Insurance Reference > Plan tab. However, if the Patient does not have a Plan selected in the Primary/Secondary tabs, the deductible amount can be entered here.If you do not use insurance estimating, the Deductible amount will remain until it is manually edited.If you do use insurance estimating, the Deductible amounts will reduce according to the estimated benefits.Remaining CoverageThe Remaining Coverage column will pull from the Annual Coverage field within the Insurance Reference > Plan tab. However, if no Plan is selected the an amount can be added to the Remaining Coverage column.If you do not use insurance estimating, the Remaining Coverage will reduce as you receive insurance payments.If you do use insurance estimating, the Remaining Coverage amounts will reduce according to the estimated benefits.Remaining Ortho Coverage *Not present in MacPractice MD, DC or 20/20*This column will pull the amount entered in the Max Ortho Benefit field in the Insurance Reference > Plan tab. If this amount is left blank or no plan has been selected, an amount can be added to the Remaining Ortho column.Once this has been setup on the Patient or Plan, the Ortho coverage will be reduced by charges associated with an "Orthodontic" Procedure Type.SubscriberThis field will pull the person's name associated to the insurance listed in this row. This will be based on the Name entered in the Primary/Secondary tab. This will always match the selection made in the Primary/Secondary tab.EmployerThe Employer column will pull the Employer selected within the Insurance Table for the insurance listed in this row. If none is selected, this column will remain blank. This will always match the selection made in the Primary/Secondary tab.Plan NameThis column will display the Plan selected within the Insurance table for the insurance listed in this row. If there isn't a Plan selected, this column will remain blank. This will always match the selection made in the Primary/Secondary tab and can be changed there.Start and End DateStart Date and End Date pull in from the Primary/Secondary tabs but may be manually edited if needed.The Start Date is the date the patient first gained this insurance. If you do not know the specific date, it is sufficient to enter a rough approximation, such as the patient's first visit. This information is not reported on claims, but it is used to allocate balances between the Insurance Portion and Patient Portion.The End Date field should only be used if coverage terminates. This field is rarely filled out when you first add insurance to a patient's record.For example, if a patient left their employer and was no longer covered by the selected insurance.Group #*Canadian Claim Fields Checked: Policy #*The Group # column can populate based on what was entered in the Insurance Group # column in Primary/Secondary tabs. However, if a Group # is entered in the Employer table of the Primary/Secondary tab, this may override the Insurance Group #.Medicare TypeUse the Medicare Type menu to select a Medicare as Secondary reason, if applicable.HIPAA Release and DateBelow the insurance table, you can indicate the patient's current HIPAA Release status, and enter the HIPAA Release Date, if applicable. This can be set in a default patient record, updated for the whole database through a utility, or overridden on eclaims. Referrals Sub TabThe Referrals tab is designed to document unique transitions to and from the Referrers involved. This document uses the terms referral and referrer as follows:To add a referral to the patient's record, click the plus button in the upper right corner of the referral area. In the resulting window, search for and select the referrer. If the referrer is not present within the list, click the plus button to create a new referrer record. Referrers can also be added in the Referrers Reference.As in the previous tabs, the columns can be arranged in any order that best fits the office's workflow. Simply click the column header and drag it left or right, then release.The Referrals tab contains the following columns:

This field may help offices define the type of specialty service the referral preforms. To add new specialties, go to the Referral Specialty Reference and click the green plus. StatusThis drop down menu can be used to indicate whether the patient is still actively seeing the referral listed. This field is not editable, and a user can choose between "Active" and "Inactive".Referrer TypeThis field defines what type of referral this is.For example, did the patient hear about the practice via a Facebook Ad? If so, this would be considered a "Marketing" Referral Type.

Custom Sub-TabUse the Custom tab to associate the patient to items from your Custom reference list. This area is completely user-definable. Some offices use this area to list a patient's preferred pharmacy, or indicate medical study participation. You can run reports on your Custom entries using the MacPractice Inspector Pane or the Patients marketing report.Click the green plus above the custom table to open up the search window where you may either search for or select a custom record from the list. If the record is not present, use the plus button to create a new one (you can also create custom entries through References). Alerts Sub TabUse this space to enter alerts that pertain to a patient, rather than all patients on an account. Some common alerts include warnings about a patient's serious medical condition, language barrier, phobia, or other situations that would affect patient care. Click the plus button above the Alert table to open the search window. Search or scroll through to select the alert. If the record is not present, use the plus button to create a new one. New alerts may be created through the Patient Alert node within the References ability. MacPractice does not recommend adding actual patient names to the alerts, such as "Sally is always late," as this reference is available on all patients throughout the database. Use an alert such as "Habitually late to appointments" instead.Once a patient has been assigned an alert, a yellow triangle will display in the patient selector. Click this triangle to view the alert pop-up (provided you have appropriate privileges to view alerts). If you don't want the alter pop-up to appear automatically, it can be disabled by going to Preferences > General > General tab > Uncheck "Show Patient and Account Alerts". The bottom of the Alerts tab can be used to add information if the patient is deceased. Enter a diagnosis for the cause and edit the date of death. When these fields are used, the patient's age will be listed in red. Appointments Sub-TabThe Appointments Tab contains appointment data for the patient. This tab will only appear if the Scheduling Ability is purchased on your license.Appointment information cannot be edited in this window.

 Notes Sub-TabThe Notes tab is a free-text area where you can enter miscellaneous notes about the patient. It does not directly correspond to the Notes ability, though there is a pull field you can use to put this information in a Note record. This may be used to keep track of conversational information for the patient, not intended to be a part of their permanent medical record.No clinical information should be added into this box as it can be deleted with no past record of what was in the box. Please check out Notes, EMR, EHR, or Clinical Notes for provider records.  Emergency Sub-TabUse the Emergency tab to enter information about the patient's emergency contacts.Click the plus sign in the upper right corner to add a new Emergency Contact record, then enter the contact's Last Name, First Name, and Phone number. You can also use the Relationship to Patient menu to indicate how they know the patient.

To record a communication, click the plus button on the communication table. In the resulting sheet, add the date and time of the communication then select the method and type from the respective menus. Add any notes about it and click Done.Below the Communication table, set a patient's AutoRemind profile in the menu or select how the patient prefers to receive Follow-Up or Recall reminders in the Communications Preference menu. Set up additional Communication Methods and Types in the References. For offices that use the AutoRemind Appointment notification feature, line items may periodically be added to the section without user intervention. These line items are miscellaneous data regarding communication with AutoRemind but are not a reliable source of information to confirm if a patient received an appointment reminder. Please check the AutoRemind Portal for this information. Race/Ethnicity Sub-TabFrom the Race/Ethnicity tab, you can add and remove demographic information for the patient in question.
