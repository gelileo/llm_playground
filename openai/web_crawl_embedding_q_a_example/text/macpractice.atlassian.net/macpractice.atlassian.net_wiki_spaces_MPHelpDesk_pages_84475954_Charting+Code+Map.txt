The mapped code appears in blue font in the upper half of the Charting Code Map view.Open Organizing the codes within categories is similar to the way that files may be organized within folders on a computer. These category "folders" are used to create the paths that the Charting Code Map uses to find the particular codes for the material, region, type of procedure, tooth surfaces, and so on. The path created by mapping the code will be listed below the categories in the Charting Code Map. The D1351 Sealant charted in the example above displays Current Location: Sealants -> D1351.Before setting up the Charting Code Map, a Fee Schedule with the charting fee codes should be created to be used to add the procedures you'll need to populate the Charting Code Map.Mapping CodesTo place a code within a category, simply click and drag codes from the Fee Schedule Code list into that category's folder.Adding a code to the Sealants category would make it possible to apply this code through the Sealants node of the Charting Menu in a patient's Dental chart.Codes that are listed in black have yet to be mapped, while codes in blue are already mapped.Categories and SubcategoriesThe Charting Code Map is organized into main Charting categories which relate directly to the options available in the Charting Menu. The Charting Map Categories and first level of Sub-Categories are:Exam & RadiologyAnterior OnlyPosterior OnlyCrownsFull3/4ProvisionalPrefabTempRoot CanalPrimary Tooth OnlyAnterior OnlyPosterior OnlySealantsAnterior OnlyPosterior OnlyImplant ServiceAnterior OnlyPosterior OnlyBridge/FPDFull3/4 ExtractionAnterior OnlyPosterior OnlyRPDRegularMetalVeneerUnilateralInterimSurface RestorationInlayOnlayVeneerAmalgamResin-based CompositeGold FoilSedativePosts & CorePrefabricatedCast Each of the categories contain different subcategories that relate to the options determined by the type of procedure. For example, the Crowns category can be divided into subcategories that apply to the level of the procedure such as Full, 3/4, Provisional, Prefab, and Temp. Codes. These subcategories are further divided into the types of material that may be used to perform the procedures. For example, a 3/4 Crown could be performed with Resin, Cast High Noble, Cast Pred. Base, Cast Noble, or Porcelain/Ceramic.Mapping a Fee Schedule's code within Crowns -> 3/4 -> Cast Pred. Base would make this code chartable for this Fee Schedule by selecting Crowns -> 3/4 -> Cast Pred. Base in the Charting Options Menu.   Deleting CodesTo delete a code from the Charting Code Map, simply click the code in the lower half of the Charting Code Map view, and press the delete key on your keyboard. You'll see a confirmation prompt asking if you're sure.WARNING: In older builds of MacPractice (7.3 and prior), removing the last code in a folder could remove the folder itself, necessitating reverting to the default Charting Code Map.  Deleted codes will remain in the Fee Schedule, but it will no longer be chartable via the Charting Menu of the Dental Tab.Mapping Additional Fee SchedulesWhen charting past procedures in Completed Treatments, procedures and materials that are not typically used may not be present in your current Fee Schedule. In this situation, a separate Fee Schedule can be created with mapped codes for the procedures beyond what the office would generally perform. This Fee Schedule could be used to add the necessary codes. This process will maintain a Fee Schedule that is distinctly applicable to the office's actual procedures, but allow for the accurate charting of past procedures and materials with a second Fee Schedule.For example, an office that does not normally perform Amalgam restorations may not have an Amalgam code in the Fee Schedule. When attempting to chart a two surface Amalgam restoration, the Charting Menu indicates that the option is not available.By using a Fee Schedule created specifically for past procedures rather than codes that are actually performed, the codes can be mapped in the Charting Code Map without adding the codes to your most commonly used Fee Schedule. In the Fee Schedule used on the left of this paragraph, a code has been mapped in the Charting Code Map under Surface Restoration -> Amalgam -> Two Surfaces. When the Fee Schedule is selected in the Charting Menu, the Amalgam can be charted.  Importing and Exporting Charting MapBefore importing a Charting Code Map, make sure you have a fresh backup available!Charting Code Maps can be imported to and exported from MacPractice. This can be valuable if you are trying to standardize the dental chart between offices, or you want to try some incremental changes to your Charting Code Map that you can easily revert.You can Import and Export your Code Map by clicking the "Import..." or "Export..." buttons in the lower right corner of the Charting Code Map.Importing your Charting MapThe Import button, when clicked, will present you with the prompt shown in the image below.The red warning should be followed, as any charting work done while importing could cause unforeseen problems in your MacPractice database. You should also take this time to confirm that you have a fresh backup available before proceeding.You can choose to either fully replace your current code map with the imported map by selecting "Replace the Current Code Map". You can also choose "Add to the Current Code Map" if you intend on adding imported codes to the existing codes on your Charting Code Map.Once you click OK, you will be prompted to select a .CMP file. Locate the previously exported file, and select it. You should see a message at the bottom of the MacPractice screen indicating if the code map was imported successfully.Exporting your Charting MapThe Export button will provide a Save prompt where you can save the Charting Code Map. Be sure to pick a location you can easily access. You may need to authenticate in order to Export, so make sure you also have your computer password at hand.The file will be saved as a .CMP file.
