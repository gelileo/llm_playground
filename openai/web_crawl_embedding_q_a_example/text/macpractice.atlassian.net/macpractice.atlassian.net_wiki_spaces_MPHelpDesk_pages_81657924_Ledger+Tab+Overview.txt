The ledger is most obviously used for accounting and adding transactions for your patients, but it can also be used to view clinical information.1 Incident Sidebar2 Transactions Table Columns3 Balance OverviewOpen Incident SidebarThe Incident Sidebar displays all unarchived incidents for the patient, as well as the Treatment Plans Folder and Account Ledger (which contains transactions for all patients on the account). Above the incident list is the Incident Menu, which can be used to create, archive, retrieve or delete incidents.Open

Incident

Treatment PlansThe Treatment Plans node in the Ledger sidebar is generally used as a quick view of all existing Treatment Plans.The Treatment Plan Status can also be adjusted here. If the cursor is moved next to the status, an x will appear. Clicking the x will hide the treatment plan from this view but will not remove it.Account LedgerThe Account Ledger is a list of all Ledger activity in a single account. You can expand the Account Ledger and select the individual Patient to view all of their transactions on one place. You cannot post, open or delete a payment/charge in this area. If you attempt to preform one of these actions while in the Account Ledger, you will be taken to the incident associated with the item, and the transaction will be highlighted.The Account Ledger is also the only place where you will be able to see Finance Charges on the account, because a finance charge is applied to the account as a whole, not a specific incident. Typically, the finance charges are based upon the Provider/Office selected in the patient's Account tab; however, these may be overridden by double clicking and editing directly on the patient's Account Ledger. IncidentThe Incident allows users to separate a patient's transactions by date, type of procedure, reason for visit, or any number of criteria.When selected, the Incident will display the Incident Tabs  on the right side of the screen. These tabs are used to add more details regarding the selected incident as well as adding additional information on claims. Once you expand the incident you can select the Contract Billing (if any), Transactions and Treatment Plan for that incident.

Transactions Table ColumnsThe Transaction Table is a series of columns that contain all of the financial information within the selected incident.Above this table are the Charges, Payments, Other, Print and View Options menus. Each menu contains several difference functions. You can also customize the Ledger Colors for the transactions to whatever makes sense for your office.Columns can be dragged and dropped into any order desired. So yours may not match exactly with the order displayed. We recommend dragging the columns that you would want to reference quickly to the left, this will prevent unnecessary scrolling.

Acct. Balance
Ins. Portion
Pat. Portion
Unapplied
Primary Coverage
Deductible

Acct. BalanceThis number is the total unpaid amount that is owed on the account.Ins. PortionThis number is the total amount estimated to be owed to the Account from Insurance. If multiple Patients exist in the Account, this number will most likely not match one Patient's balance.This is based on a couple of different factors.The way plans and charges are setup with Insurance Estimating. If Insurance is estimated to cover a specific amount, that amount will be reflected in the Ins. Portion.Any unpaid open claims without Insurance Estimating will show the total amount unpaid in the Insurance Portion. Upon payment, the remainder of the amount owed will transfer to the Patient Portion.Information on how the Portions will break down can be found in the Portion Troubleshooting table.The Insurance Portion is also included in the Aging Table below. The first column will show the Balance Total for the Insurance Portion. Then the total will be broken down by 0-30 Days, 31-60 Days, 61-90 Days, 91-120 Days, and 120+ Days. Pat. PortionThis number is the total amount estimated to be owed to the Account from the Patient or Patients on the Account. If multiple Patients exist in the Account, this number will most likely not match one Patient's balance.If Insurance Estimating is used, this number will reflect what the Patient is most likely to pay based on the details entered into MacPractice.The Patient Portion is also included in the Aging Table below. The first column will show the Balance Total for the Patient Portion. Then the total will be broken down by 0-30 Days, 31-60 Days, 61-90 Days, 91-120 Days, and 120+ Days. UnappliedThis is the amount of payments that have been posted to the Account but not yet applied to any charges. This number will appear in red if it is any amount except $0.00. Unapplied payments will appear in the Transactions Table for every Patient in the Account, but may be intended for a charge on a specific Patient's Ledger.Primary CoverageThis number reflects the cost that insurance is expected to cover in a year. This number is set in the Insurance tab of the Patient Ability. Insurance payments will cause this number to decrease (so if Insurance pays $100, then $100 will be removed from the Primary Coverage). The number will also decrease if Insurance Estimating is used. This serves to keep an estimate of how much an insurance company is likely to pay on the patient's behalf.This does not take into effect any service the insurance may cover outside of the office if it is not kept track of in the office's Ledger.If no Insurance Plan is set for the Patient, then "No Insurance Plan" will appear. Once a Plan has been applied, the Primary Coverage will appear in blue text.If multiple Insurance Companies are used by the patient, this number will only reflect the Primary Coverage from the Primary Insurance (or the Insurance Company listed on the top of the Patient's Insurance tab.)This will only apply to the selected Patient. If there are multiple Patients on the Account, another Patient will need to be selected in order to see their Primary Coverage.DeductibleThis is the Deductible that the patient will pay based on their Insurance carrier. Similar to Primary Coverage, this number is set in the Insurance tab of the Patient Ability. A Deductible is applied if the Charge has a Procedure Type that is designated Applies to Deductible in the Plans tab inside the Insurance Company Reference.If no Insurance Plan is set for the Patient, then "No Insurance Plan" will appear. Once a Plan has been applied, the Deductible will appear in blue text.If multiple Insurance Companies are used by the patient, this number will only reflect the Deductible from the Primary Insurance (or the Insurance Company listed on the top of the Patient's Insurance tab.)This will only apply to the selected Patient. If there are multiple Patients on the Account, another Patient will need to be selected in order to see their Deductible.
