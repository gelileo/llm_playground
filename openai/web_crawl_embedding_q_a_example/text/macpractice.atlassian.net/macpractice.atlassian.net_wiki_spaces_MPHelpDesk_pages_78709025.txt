With a fingerprint in place, the file can be verified to determine if it has been changed.To create a file fingerprint (hash) for any exported file, such as reports or patient data, select Generate File Fingerprint. From the resulting menu, select the exported file and click the Open button to generate the file's fingerprint.Once the fingerprint is generated, click the OK button. The fingerprint (hash) file will be generated with the original file name, including the format SHA256.File Fingerprinting uses a SHA-256 algorithm to verify data if changed in a file. The SHA-256 (i.e.: SHA-2) hash function is used in as security in applications and protocols and serves as the secure algorithm required by US Government applications and commercial applications with sensitive data. More information can be found in NIST's Policy on Hash Functions.To verify a file's Fingerprint, you can select Verify File Fingerprint to test the validity of a generated File Fingerprint file. From the resulting menu, select the fingerprint file with the .SHA256 extension, then click the Open button. If changes have not been made, the resulting verification window will indicate that the verification has passed. If the fingerprinted file has been changed, the notification window will indicate a verification failure, such as the fingerprint file was not created or the fingerprint file has been modified.If the fingerprinted file has been separated from the file fingerprint (hash) file, the verification process will not function properly. The file fingerprint, with extension .SHA256, should always be located with the fingerprinted file.Encrypting and Decrypting FilesThe Encrypt/Decrypt item encrypts and decrypts an exported file for the purposes of security. To encrypt or decrypt a file select the File menu and choose the Encrypt/Decrypt item. The submenu includes items to Encrypt File and Decrypt File. The Encrypt/Decrypt item uses the AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption method, the same symmetric key encryption used by the US Government. Edit MenuThe Edit menu displays items that edit and manipulate information.The Edit menu contains standard menu items, typically found in other Mac OS X applications, such as:Undo: Reverts the previous action.Redo: Reverts the previous Undo action.Cut: Copies and cuts the selected data.Copy: Copies the selected data.Paste: Pastes the copied data.Paste & Match Style: Pastes the copied data while matching surrounding text style (font, size, color, and so on).Delete: Deletes the selected data.Select All: Selects all contents within a field.Special Characters: Opens the Special Characters window to input Mac OS X supported characters.Some menu items are MacPractice specific, such as:New Record: Creates a new record.Delete Record: Deletes the selected record.Save Record: Saves the selected record.Revert Record: Reverts all previous actions to the selected record.Clear Record: Removes all data from the selected record.Duplicate Record: Creates a copy of the selected record.View MenuThe View menu displays items that maneuver to MacPractice abilities, or views.Show Tab Bar: On macOS High Sierra and up, this will display the Tab Bar in the MacPractice software just below the Toolbar.Show All Tabs: On macOS High Sierra and up, this will display all currently open tabs.
