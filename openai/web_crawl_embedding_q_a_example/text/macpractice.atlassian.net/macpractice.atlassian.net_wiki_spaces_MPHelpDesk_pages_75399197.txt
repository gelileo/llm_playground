Rejected claims have passed DentalXChange validation, were forwarded to the payer, and sent back to DentalXChange because the payer found a problem. On the Problem Claims page, click the link in the Status column to view the claim details and claim errors. If you need to delete a claim, check the box in the Delete column and click the delete button near the bottom of the page. If you experience any issues deleting claims, try using an external browser, such as Safari or Firefox, instead of using the Internet ability in MacPractice.The reason for the error will be displayed at the top of the Claim Details page. Please review these error messages and use them to fix your claims.You may fix your claim directly on DentalXChange, but please note this does not change any information in MacPractice. You will likely want to also fix the problem in MacPractice to avoid any confusion or any future problems. It is MacPractice's recommendation that all incorrect information for claims be corrected within MacPractice, rebuilt, and then re-sent, rather than just correcting at DentalXchange. Correcting at DentalXchange does not fix any incorrect information that is entered into MacPractice.
