If a payer does not accept electronic claims, there are a number of options available to the user. 1 Create a Paper Claim2 Drop to Paper Option at Change Healthcare Clearinghouse3 Force eClaim to PaperCreate a Paper ClaimOne option is to create a paper claim within the ledger of the patient and mail it the old fashioned way.To create a paper claim in the patient ledger, highlight the items that need to be sent to insurance within the ledger.

In the Company Info Tab, change the Claims Payer ID to "PAPER". What this does is it communicates the clearinghouse system to check to see if there is a payer ID whose address information matches the address information that is present in the claim.If the system finds a payer ID that has matching address information, the clearinghouse will add the appropriate payer ID to the outbound claim file and send electronically to the payer.If the clearinghouse system does not find a matching address for the payer ID on the claim, Change Healthcare will convert the electronic claim to a paper claim and mail the paper claim to the address that is indicated in the claim file.There is no 'PAPER' equivalent for Change Healthcare Dental. The DentalXchange equivalent to 'PAPER' would be 'DXPRT'.Force eClaim to PaperThere may be an additional charge when this option is used.

Within the insurance reference, in the Company Info Tab, change the Claims Payer ID to 'PRINT'.For DentalXchange or Change Healthcare Dental eClaims, go to the insurance reference. In the Company Info Tab, change the Claims Payer ID to '06126'. This will force dental claims to be printed on paper and mailed from the clearinghouse.When the payer ID "PRINT" is used, Change Healthcare will not try to match the payer in the claim file to a known payer ID. The eClaim file will go straight to being converted to a paper claim and will be mailed to the address that appears in the eClaim file.
