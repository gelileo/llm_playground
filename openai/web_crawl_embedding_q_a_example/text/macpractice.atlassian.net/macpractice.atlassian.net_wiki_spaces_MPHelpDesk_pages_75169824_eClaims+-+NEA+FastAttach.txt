Some clients and vendors may refer to NEA as 'Vyne' or 'Vyne Dental'.Note: NEA only allows submission of .jpg image file types. Any image(s) using a different file type will be automatically converted to .jpg upon submission. However, in versions prior to 4.1.5.24, .pdf documents cannot be converted by MacPractice. Convert any .pdf documents to .jpg documents prior to submission and save multi-page .pdf documents as multiple .jpg images.Submitting attachments to the NEA through MacPractice may require additional configuration of your network, specifically in terms of ports 80 and 443. Please review the Firewall section for more information on configuring the network.File Size: There is a limit for image size imposed by NEA. Anything over 2 MB will be compressed by MacPractice in efforts to reach the file size restriction. This could cause issues with quality on images that are larger in size. SetupOnce the NEA FastAttach interface has been purchased and the enrollment is complete, an EDI support representative will assist with setup. Within Preferences > FastAttach, add the unique facility ID and serial number provided by EDI.Open To limit the size of image uploads to NEA, set Attachment Image Size menu to the desired size or manually add the pixel values to the Width and Height fields.Open Each provider that you will be uploading images for will also need to have a State License Number and Tax ID entered in the provider's User reference. NEA cannot accept uploads from providers without this information.Using FastAttachBefore uploading images using the NEA FastAttach feature, attachment files should be associated to the patient in Attachments, Imaging, or Digital Radiography. To upload images, create a charge or choose an existing charge to attach to the file. To create a new charge, use the Charges menu and select New Charge. To open an existing charge, either double click on it in the ledger, or highlight the charge, then use the Charges menu and select Open Selected Transaction.In the New Charge window, enter a procedure and select the Attachments tab. From the Attachment tab, click the plus button for the FastAttach window.In the FastAttach window, all attachments that are associated to the patient will appear in the Available Images column.Create a new attachment record for this charge by clicking the plus button. Select the insurance carrier. Select the incident the images are associated to. If the images are not associated to an incident, select ‘None' in the Incident menu. Drag the image to upload from the Available Images Column to into the Submitted Images area, as shown below.Next, the Image Code, Image Type, Image Orientation, and Image Quadrant menus to the right of the FastAttach window will be activated.Image Orientation:Select the orientation in which the x-ray was scanned or captured by your digital imaging system:The left side is the patient’s right side – The left side of the x-ray is the right side of the patient’sface.The right side is the patient’s left side – The right side of the x-ray is the left side of the patient’sfaceSelect values from the menus, and click the Submit button to continue. MacPractice will then upload the image(s) to NEA.Once the image has uploaded, the FastAttach window will vanish. The Unique ID will appear under the Attachment tab in the New Charge window, indicating that the file upload was successful. Once you have created your electronic claim, the Unique ID will be attached to the claim. Click the Save button if you are finished billing for this procedure. Continue billing as needed, or submit the eClaim as you normally would.To confirm that the image's unique ID has been associated to the eClaim, select the claim in the eClaims ability. With the claim selected, the claim details will be in the bottom left area. Expand the Procedure node, find the appropriate procedure code and scroll down until you find the Paperwork node. Expand the Paperwork node and the unique ID will be in the Attachment Control Number field.Note: Only one attachment record can be associated to a claim. Only one charge on any claim should contain an NEA record, and only one NEA record may be added per charge. Any number of images can be added to an attachment record at the time of creating the attachment.Once an attachment is created and uploaded, additional images cannot be added to the attachment. A new attachment must be created. If it is determined that required images were omitted from an attachment record that has already been uploaded, a new attachment record needs to be created that includes the images images from the previously uploaded attachment. Add the previously added images and the additional images before uploading the new attachment.NEA/FastAttach TroubleshootingMasterID Lookup ErrorIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says "MasterID Lookup Error," this may mean that the payer ID is missing for the selected insurance company.Builds 7.3 and earlier:Builds 11 and upReturn to the Insurance Company reference and be sure the Payer ID field has been filled out. Please also check that the Payer ID field has been filled out correctly if there is a plan set on the insurance for this patient.NEA cross-references the Change Healthcare payer ID's against their internal reference number for each individual payer. It is important that the payer ID entered in the Insurance Reference of MacPractice exactly matches the payer ID that shows in the NEA Payer ID list for the clearinghouse.Change Healthcare - https://secure.nea-fast.com/cgi-bin/trans1?cid=1 In addition to an invalid payer ID this error could also mean that the ‘Insurance Reference Name’ is longer than 50 characters. If the payer ID is correct, check to see if the reference name is longer than 50 characters.In newer builds of MacPractice we are now able to validate off of multiple payer lists for the NEA module. As such, we need to have a way to distinguish between them. If the insurance reference has the default eClaims template set to 'None', then the 'Master ID Lookup' error will be prompted. To remedy the issue, make sure an eClaims template is set in the dropdown of the insurance reference. Invalid parameter: doctor first name, Message: is requiredIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says “Invalid parameter: doctor first name, Message: is required" this means that the field “Provider Shown on Claim” in the charge window is set to ‘None’. Return to the ‘New Charge’ window and set the ‘Provider Shown on Claim’ field to the applicable billing provider for the charge.From here you should be able to submit your image(s).Invalid parameter - Missing Subscriber IDIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says “Invalid parameter: insureds id, Message: is required,” this means that the ‘Subscriber ID’ is missing from the insurance reference on the patients chart.  You will want to go back to the patient’s account to the Primary/Secondary tab and fill out the field for ‘Subscriber ID’. After saving the record you may return to the charge window to attach your image(s).Invalid Parameter - Missing State License NumberIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says “Invalid parameter: doctor license number, Message: is required’ this means that the provider’s ‘State License Number’ is missing from their user reference. You will want to access their user reference at References > Users > (provider’s name) > Provider > Claim Credentials. Here you can enter the provider’s ‘State License Number’. After saving the record you will be able to submit your image(s).Invalid Parameter - Missing Tax IDIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says “Invalid parameter: doctor tax id, Message: is required’ this means that the provider’s ‘Tax ID’ is missing from their user reference. You will want to access their user reference at References > Users > (provider’s name) > Provider > Claim Credentials. Here you can enter the provider’s Tax ID in the field labeled ‘Federal’. After saving the record you will be able to submit your image(s).Master ID: does not support image codeIn the FastAttach window, if you click the Submit button and get a warning that says 'Master ID: does not support image code’ this means that selected image code in the NEA interface is not a valid selection.In the NEA interface select a different image code from the dropdown and then submit.The following images codes will produce an error upon submission.CephalometricCode:11Cred.

However, if you drag an image to the "Submitted Images" section, you are able to  immediately click the Submit button but this will yield a Master ID Lookup Error. This can suggest that the NEA account has either been canceled, payment has lapsed, or the Facility ID/Serial Number is incorrect. Solution: Please contact the EDI Department at MacPractice so that we can open up a research case to troubleshoot your issue for you further. General Error CodeIssue: After submitting an NEA transaction you receive a 'General Error' code. Solution: Please check that the proper Facility ID is entered under MacPractice Preferences > NEA FastAttach. If you do not know your Facility ID please contact MacPractice EDI Support for assistance.
