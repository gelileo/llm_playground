Just Print, Don't Save CheckboxBy default, MacPractice will save a PDF of every claim created to the patient's ledger. We recommend keeping this PDF in case the claim needs to be reprinted or viewed in the future. To view the claim, simply double click on the line.However, you may choose to disable this feature for a claim; for instance, if you are simply printing it for the patient or doing a test print to verify information on it. In the claim creation window, uncheck the box and the claim will generate, but a copy will not be saved. If you are choosing not to save PDFs because of space, please consider a database utility that would delete PDFS of claims that have been closed and are past a certain age. Encounter Form NumberIf you add an encounter form number to this field, the Encounter Form within the Encounter Tracker can be marked as "Received" directly from the Claim Creation Window.The Encounter Form Number is listed in the Serial # column within the Encounter Tracker entry line.
