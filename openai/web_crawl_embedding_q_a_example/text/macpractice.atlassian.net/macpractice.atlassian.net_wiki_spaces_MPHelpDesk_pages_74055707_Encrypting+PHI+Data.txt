When sending information to MacPractice that contains patient data, such as an insurance card, it is necessary to send this informations as an encrypted attachment.In order to encrypt an image use the following steps:Open the image in preview.Open In Preview go to File > Export as PDFOpen You will then see a window prompting you to save the image. You will want to click the Show Details button.In the box that pops down, check the box to Encrypt. You will need to create a password here. The recipient will need this password to open the file.  Once this is added click Save.The file should then appear in the location that you saved it, however it should show as a locked PDF. This will be what you will add to your email.You will want to send two emails. The first email should contain the file and an explanation that a second email will be sent containing the password to open the encrypted file. The second email should contain the password to open the file.Another good practice is to tell the recipient the file's password while on the phone with them, rather than in a second email. This reduces the risk of unwanted recipients opening the file should another party inadvertently receive it.When the recipient attempts to open the encrypted document they will be promoted to enter the password:The recipient will then be able to enter the password here to open/view the document.
