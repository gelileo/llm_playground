The default path is /Users/NAME/Library/Application Support/MacPracticeClient/Databases/macpractice/WindowsBridge.Open Open Some bridges will also have a "Settings" section where you can select the Application Path. Type the file path of the Windows DR application. In most cases this will be something like "C:\DEXIS" or "C:Program Files\DEXIS". If you are using Windows 7 in 64 bit mode, it may be "C:\Program Files (x86)" instead of simply "Program Files".
