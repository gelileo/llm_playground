For example, you can define a User Group to represent the level of access a Front Desk user would need, and then another User Group to determine what level of access a Provider should have. This way, you can simply assign a User Group to a User via the Users Reference.Open 1 Default User Groups2 Creating User Groups3 Duplicating an Existing User Group4 User Privilege List4.1 Accounting4.2 Alerts4.3 Charting4.4 Clinical4.5 Database4.6 Digital Radiography4.7 eClaims4.8 EMR/EDR4.9 EHR4.10 Images/Attachments4.11 Inspector4.12 Inventory4.13 Labs4.14 Ledger4.15 List4.16 Managers4.17 Notes4.18 Optical4.19 Order4.20 Patients4.21 Perio4.22 References4.23 Reports4.24 Reputation Marketing (Reputation Loop)4.25 Rx4.26 Scheduling4.27 Security4.28 Services/Products4.29 TimeclockDefault User GroupsBy default, we have four pre-set User Groups:Administrator: By default, all privileges for an Administrator are enabled. You can edit this group to include fewer privileges.Kiosk User: A set of permissions ideal for a Kiosk User. A User can only select this group if if "Is Kiosk Machine User" is enabled under their User Information tab of the Users Reference.Others: The default setting for all users. "Others" has the minimum privileges for an employee to functionally use MacPractice.SuperAdm: Stands for "Super Admin". This group has all privileges enabled, but cannot be edited. This group is usually reserved for the owner of the practice or their office manager, and should not be granted to normal users.Specific privilege sets for certain groups can be designed to suit any needs outside of the default User Groups.Note: By default, only the Administrator and SuperAdmin User Groups have the privileges to adjust User Group Privileges. At least one User in the office should belong to one of these groups so that privileges can be adjusted should an unusual function need to be performed. MacPractice Support is not able to adjust User Group Privileges for any office.Edit this section Add a section Delete this section Add a question to this section Show / Hide section information.Creating User GroupsUser Group Privilege set can be designed for each group.
