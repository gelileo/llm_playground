The article is split into two parts: options that pull information for a single patient, or options that pull information from the entire database.If none of these options address your current needs, you can also speak to our Conversions Department by calling Support and requesting to speak to a member of Conversions regarding your needs. Alternately, you can reach out to exports@macpractice.com.1 Single Patient1.1 Attachments/Images1.2 Exporting a Clinical Summary (CDA)1.3 Demographics1.4 DR Images1.5 EMR/EDR Patient Forms1.6 EHR Patient Forms1.7 Ledger - Exporting an Incident1.8 Dental - Perio Records2 Entire Database2.1 Reports2.2 Managers/Statements2.3  Attachments/Images2.4 DR Images2.5 EDR/EMR Narratives2.6 Notes2.7 Additional InformationSingle PatientAttachments/ImagesOpen If you'd like to retrieve all attachments for a particular patient, navigate to the Attachments Ability and select the patient in question. Once you've done this, you can navigate to the File Menu > "Print All Attachments For Patient.."This option is available in MacPractice Gen 9 and up.  Open You'll be presented with a window that allows you to control which attachments are exported. Once you're satisfied with your selection, click "Print".     The print window will then appear. From here, you can either print a copy of your attachments for this patient, or you can use the "PDF" drop down menu to either preview the attachments as PDFs, or you can save them.      Finally, you can manually select an attachment you'd like to save, then right click the preview and choose "Save As...". You can then choose where you would like to save the attachment. Exporting a Clinical Summary (CDA)If you need to export a patient’s Clinical Summary, it’ll depend on which build you are on.If you’re on Build 11 or higher, please follow the instructions in this linked article here.If you’re on Build 10 or lower, please follow the instructions listed below. With any patient, you can export their Clinical Summary by navigating to the Patients Ability > Clinical Tab. Select an Incident in the upper left "Incident" Drop down menu, and then with an Incident selected, in the upper right click on the "Export Incident..." drop down. Choose "To Patient..." This will bring up the Export dialogue box.From here, you can customize what information is pulled onto the Clinical Summary, and you can then preview all of the contents of the Summary. If you want to Print the summary, simply select the Print radio button at the top and click the Export button in the lower right corner. From there, the print dialogue will appear as normal, so you can print or save as a PDF as you desire. DemographicsThe best way to capture a single patient's demographics is to print off a Patient Face Sheet. This is easily done by navigating to the Patient Ability, selecting a patient, then either navigating to the File Menu > Print. Alternatively, you can use the Command-P keyboard shortcut to print.Remember to use the PDF Preview option if you would prefer to have a PDF of the Patient Face Sheet instead. DR ImagesIn the DR Ability, you can export a visit's worth of images by right clicking on the visit in question, then select "Export all Visit Images".  EMR/EDR Patient FormsYou can print off all of an individual patient's forms by first navigating to the EDR/EMR ability, then selecting the desired patient. Once a patient is selected, you can then navigate to the EDR/EMR menu and select "Print (x)'s Patient Forms", where (x) will display the currently selected patient. You can also print all of an individual patient's narratives as well from this option. EHR Patient FormsIf you'd like to print all EHR Patient Forms for a particular patient, navigate to the EHR Ability and select the patient in question. Once you've done this, you can navigate to the File Menu and select "Print Patient's EHR Forms"This option is available in MacPractice Gen 9 and up.Once you've clicked Print EHR Forms, a window will appear allowing you to select specifically which forms you'd like to print for this patient. You can pick specific templates or incidents, or use the date filters to narrow results down to a more specific range, or uncheck specific forms that you do not want to include. When you're satisfied, click Print to bring up the Print interface, where you can choose your printer.If you only need to print off a specific form, you can select that form in the EHR Ability and use the basic Print option. Ledger - Exporting an IncidentYou can export the Ledger items of an Incident to an Excel spreadsheet format. To do this, navigate to the Patient Ability > Ledger Tab with the desired patient selected. From there, click on the desired Incident's Transactions node in the Ledger sidebar. The "Export to Excel" option is in the Other drop-down menu. Dental - Perio RecordsThe best method to preserve Perio Records or to export them out from MacPractice is to print the records or save as a PDF. There isn't a export function available to pull all the perio records for a given patient or multiple patients. Entire DatabaseThese methods are used to extract information from the entire database.ReportsYou can access these reports by navigating to the Reports Ability. The bolded names are the nodes the reports reside in. For example, to access the Patients Report, I would navigate to the Reports Ability, and expand the "Marketing" Node.Marketing: Accounts Primary, PatientsAccounting/Financial: Accounts ReceivableClinical: Patient ClinicalInsurance: Patient By Insurance CarrierReferrals: Referred Patient By, Referred Patient ToScheduling: AppointmentsTo capture everyone in your database, you will need to run these reports with no filters checked and no date range set. For example, the Patients Report fields would look like this:For these reports you also have the option to export the report. The reports can be exported as a .txt file or as an Excel file (.xls).You can also make a list of all of the report's results by clicking the "Make List" button (visible in the above screenshot).  If you choose to use the "Make List" button, you can then export that list from the drawer. From there, you can include additional information in the exported file by using Export Presets.For more assistance on how to use Export Presets, you can either call MacPractice Support, or refer to the Creating a New Export Preset article.Managers/StatementsYou can set the filters in the Managers Abilty > Statements Manager so that all patients will receive a statement. You can use the "Print All Transactions" option in the Dates tab to capture all transactions on patient statements. This does require that all accounts have "Send Monthly Statement" set in their "Monthly Statement Options" in the Patient Ability > Account Tab set. If you have several accounts with a different Monthly Statement Option set, you can use the "Update Account Statement Status" Database Utility on the Server Computer, also within the Managers Ability, to set all accounts to the desired option.You must create a backup and ensure that all other users are logged off before running any Database Utility!  Attachments/ImagesThere is no mass-exporting of Attachments/Images. The best solution is to manually select each attachment, then you can right click the the preview and choose "Save As...". You can then choose where you would like to save the attachment. DR ImagesIn the DR Ability, you can export a visit's worth of images by right clicking on the visit in question, then selecting "Export all Visit Images". EDR/EMR NarrativesTo gather your EDR or EMR Narratives, you can run the "Export EMR Narrative PDFs" Database Utility in the Managers Ability. This can only be run on the Server Computer. Running this DB utility will create a folder on the desktop with every individual EMR Narrative in PDF format included within the folder.You must create a backup and ensure that all other users are logged off before running any Database Utility! NotesYou can export all of your Notes by navigating to the File Menu > Export, and clicking "Export Notes as PDFs".This option will generate PDFs for each patient note, labeled with the patient name and file description.Additional InformationThe majority of our Reports can be run on a per-provider basis, and exported as well into .txt or .xls formats.
