Commonly used financial statuses include "Collections," "Self Pay," "Capitation" and so on. The Financial Status of a patient is helpful when utilizing Statement Manager and as a filter on the following reports: Production By Financial Status, Accounts By Financial Status, Accounts Receivable, Production By Financial Status And Provider.The status also works in conjunction with Transworld for the Collections Manager.New items may be added to the list on the fly, simply type in any new status. If this access is restricted by User Privileges, they may be created and edited in the Financial Status Reference.Provider/OfficeThe Provider and Office fields show the overall designations for the account; which may differ from the Patient's provider and office. For example, a family may have the practice owner set as the Provider and the group's primary location as the Office; while a single patient in the account may work with another practitioner and location. Set up the default record to automatically assign a specific user and office to all new records.The Account Provider will show as the default provider in new payments, depending on how the Preferences are set up.
