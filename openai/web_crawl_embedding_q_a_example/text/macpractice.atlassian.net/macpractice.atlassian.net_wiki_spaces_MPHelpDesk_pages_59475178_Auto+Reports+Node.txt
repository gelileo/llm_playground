To access Auto Reports, go to the Reports ability and select Auto Reports in the sidebar.NOTE: Some reports have special filters that can only be accessed from the Reports ability. If one of these special filters needs to be used, Auto Reports may not be able to be used for that particular report.The report filters are at the top, with a list of all reports that can be automatically run below. Check the filters carefully - not all reports will use all filters, but the filters will be used by all reports that are run. If some reports need to be run with different filter settings they will need to be run separately.NOTE: Some reports have special filters that can only be accessed from the Reports ability. If one of these special filters needs to be used, Auto Reports may not be able to be used for that particular report.Once the filters are set, choose the Start Date and End Date range. All reports run in Auto Reports will use the same dates. If reports with different date ranges are needed run them separately. Keep in mind that some reports may filter based on the posted date, and some based on procedure date. If Auto Reports gives unexpected information, these reports may need to be run individually from the Reports ability. See the Reports documentation for more information on what to expect from each report.Open Open The Expand All checkbox allows each report, with every node and sub-node expanded, to be exported. Check this box to ensure that the most information is visible; for simpler reports, uncheck this setting.With the filters selected choose which report to run by selecting the All checkbox, or check each desired box under the Choose column.The directory for the saved file can be changed at the bottom of the window. To change the file directory, click the Browse button to select a path. Next, select between either HTML (web) or TXT (text) format to create the reports. Click Apply to run the reports and save the file.
