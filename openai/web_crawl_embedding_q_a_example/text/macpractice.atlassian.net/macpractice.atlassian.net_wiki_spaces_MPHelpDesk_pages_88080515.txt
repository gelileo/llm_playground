MacPractice has the ability to create a standard #6 envelope and the business #10 envelope. By default, these forms are disabled in MacPractice. Please read on for instructions on how to active your forms.Open    Activating & Customizing the EnvelopesStart by going to your References ability. In your sidebar, select the Forms node. Toggle the triangle down to see the information under this node. Select your #10 and/or #6 envelope. Once you select the envelope form, click the "Form Active" checkbox, so there is a checkmark in the box.Open   With the Form Active checkbox enabled, save your changes by going up to the Edit menu and choosing Save Record, or using the Command-S keyboard shortcut. Your envelopes are now ready to be used.If you have a custom or pre-printed envelope you wish to use for your office you can customize how the office address will appear on the envelope. To do this, go to the MacPractice menu and select Preferences, then select Forms in the sidebar. In the Forms preference pane, select the Settings tab.By default your envelope will have the office address print in the upper left corner; if you uncheck Print Office Address On Envelopes the address will not appear. This allows your office to use a custom pre-printed envelope. You can change the name that appears on your envelope by selecting "Print Provider on Patient Envelopes" or by changing the Default Office For Envelopes if you have another office name in MacPractice.Using the EnvelopesWith the envelopes enabled under your Forms reference, you are ready to start using the envelope forms.
