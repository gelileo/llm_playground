This node appears in several abilities in MacPractice and works the same way throughout. There are a few options for printing Notes; however, certain fields only work when printing from a specific place, such as EMR narratives or appointment data.More information on the Notes ability can be found here.Note: We have updated the MacPractice software to shift the Lists in the drawer into a separate location. You can now find your Lists in the Lists Window, accessible from the Window Menu. You can read more about the changes in Build 11 here.Patients, Schedule & ListsIn the Patients and Schedule Abilities, print a single item for a patient by dragging and dropping the patient name or appointment onto the Note Template in the sidebar. Another method is to select the form and press the plus button on the top of the sidebar, with or without a patient selected, to create the document.Open Print content for a group of patients by using the drawer or a sidebar node. Create a list of patients manually or through the Make List button in a report. Then drag the list from the drawer, or an entire node from the sidebar, onto the title of the note. This will produce one note per patient, such as welcome letters for every new patient appointment.Open EHR, EMR & EDRThe narrative from provider forms can easily be transferred onto Note Templates to create items like referral letters. The EHR, EMR or EDR narratives can be used in a note template. Simply drag the selected completed patient form onto the note template. The note template must have the EHR pull field to work with the EHR template, or the EMR/EDR pull field to work with those abilities. {""serverDuration"": 19, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""1d2336ae3d384416b6965bef3f8e020a""}",483

Creating Worker's Comp Paper Claims in MacPractice - MacPractice HelpDesk - Confluence SpacesAppsTemplatesCreateMacPractice HelpDeskAll contentCalendarsSpace settingsContentMacPractice HelpDeskLedger & ClaimsCreating Worker's Comp Paper Claims in MacPracticeShareCreating Worker's Comp Paper Claims in MacPracticeDylan NighOwned by Dylan NighLast updated: Oct 05, 2023Loading data...This article seeks to give some basic assistance on how to create Worker's Compensation Paper Claims in MacPractice. If you utilize eClaims, you'll want to refer to the eClaims article about Worker's Comp Claims instead.Warning: While we've done our best to provide a general idea of what is needed, each insurance company has different requirements for how worker's comp claims are handled. Regardless of any instructions given here, you will have to work with the payer to determine how they want worker's comp claims to be submitted.MacPractice Support is available to assist with ensuring particular information is included or formatted properly, but we cannot assist with determining what is required on a particular claim.Insurance ReferenceWhen setting up worker's comp insurance companies or specific plans, you will want to make sure the plan type is set to 'Worker's Compensation'. This will ensure that the Worker's Comp claims operate as expected; filling in the Employer's name instead of the Primary's name as the subscriber. Open Patient AbilityWhen filling out information on patient and primary tabs, this information can vary based on the payer. MOST companies would like to see the Employer listed on the claim as the subscriber (for example, in box 4 of the CMS 1500 form). The patient would then be listed as the employee as it is in this example on box 2. Check with the insurance carrier for any specific requirements.Open The plan type is what controls which name is used as patient and subscriber. When using the Worker's Comp plan type, you may leave the account's primary guarantor in the Primary tab. Some offices may choose to enter the Employer as the primary person; however, it is not required for the claim information to print correctly. On the Primary/Secondary Tab, enter the employer and the employer's Worker's Compensation Insurance below. There is an 'Employers' section in the middle third of the Primary/Secondary Tab of the Patients Ability.On the Patient Tab, be sure the patient listed is the employee for the aforementioned employer.",498

The definitions below are those used by the MacPractice Perio feature when notating a patient's Perio Chart and calculating Notation Point relationships.Abscess (ABSC): An abscess is a localized collection of suppuration or purulent exudate (pus). An Abscess is noted as True or False (1 or 0) with a Keyboard Shortcut. It is a Tooth Notation Point.Attached Gingiva (AG): Attached Gingiva is the amount of gingiva that is bound to the underlying tooth or bone. Attached Gingiva is noted by a range of 0-5 with a Keyboard Shortcut. Click the gear on the Notation Point pane and choose ""Desc"" to enter A, M, and I as descriptions. It is a Surface (Arch) Notation Point.Bleeding (BLD): Bleeding on probing or gingival bleeding is the presence of probing induced bleeding. The number of bleeding sites is used to calculated the gingival bleeding score (see Notation Point Percentages). Bleeding is noted by  (1 or 0) or 0 - 4 with Keyboard Shortcut. It is a Surface (Arch) Notation Point.Bone Loss (BLS): Bone Loss describes teeth bone loss (the loss of bone around teeth) or dental bone loss (the loss of bone not directly associated with teeth.) Bone loss is noted as True or False (1 or 0) with a Keyboard Shortcut. It is a Tooth Notation Point.Calculus (CALC): Calculus is a calcified plaque formation on the teeth. Calculus is noted by True or False (1 or 0) with the Keyboard Shortcut.",491
21,"It is a Surface (Arch) Notation Point.Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL): Clinical Attachment Loss is calculated by adding the Probing Depth to the Gingival Margin. Thus, Clinical Attachment Loss can be measured with a positive value when the gum line is below the CEJ and a negative value when the gum line is below the CEJ. Higher Clinical Attachment Loss measurements are associated with greater risk of losing a tooth. It is a Surface (Arch) Notation Point.Furcation (FURC): Furcation is the amount of gingiva destruction around a tooth due to resorption of bone, which may be indicated by exposed roots. Furcation is noted as a positive value (1-4).1 = Developing bone loss2 = Partial bone loss3 = Variable loss that does not extend completely through the furcation4 = Visible bone loss and open furcation with exposed roots or boneFurcation is noted by 1 - 4 with a Keyboard Shortcut. It is a Surface (Arch) Notation Point.Gingival Margin/Recession (GM): The Gingival Margin is the top edge of the gingiva surrounding (but not attached to) a tooth. The Gingival Margin can be considered the recession of the gum line. Gingival Margin is measured from the Cemento-enamel Junction (CEJ), with a positive value (0-15) when the gum line is below the CEJ and a negative value (-1 to -5) when the gum line is below the CEJ. Gingival Margin/Recession (GM) is noted by -5 - 15 with Keyboard Shortcut .

These alerts are based on the information that you enter in the patient's record, and may depend on some of the existing information entered in the patient's demographics, like their birth date and sex, and will also be affected by your localization settings and the units you are entering. If a value seems incorrect, be sure to check the patient's demographics, and check that you are entering the correct units based on your localization settings.In the example below, the patient's vitals have been entered, and the patient's blood pressure measures in the hypertensive category.Open  After the vitals are added to the patient's record, MacPractice immediately prompts the user for a response. The user can then specify what action was taken, in the following example, the user offered the patient information on maintaining a healthy diet. The default responses are only Ignore and Action Taken, but you can also add additional responses.Open Once the action is logged and saved, the clinical decision rule window will disappear and the user can continue entering the patient's information.

Open Incident SidebarFirst, let's address the Incident Sidebar, which contains sections for the Patient Chart, Treatment Plans, Perio Chart, and then within Incidents (the blue folders) there are sections for Completed Procedures and Treatment Plan. We will be focusing on the              Patient Chart, and within the Incident Folder we will focus on Completed Procedures and the Treatment Plan.The Patient Chart allows us to chart pre-existing work that may have not been administered by your office. Procedures added to this chart will not be charged in the Ledger. By default, these procedures are outlined in Blue by default on the chart.Completed Procedures are work that has been completed by your office. These procedures will be added to a patient's ledger, and are outlined in Green by default on the chart. It is important to stress that any procedures added to Completed Procedures will count towards the patient's balance.A Treatment Plan indicates planned work that has not been completed yet and is planned for the future. These procedures are added to a patient's Treatment Plan which can be moved to Completed at any time. These procedures are outlined in Red by default on the chart. To the right is an example of a procedure charted on the Patient Chart, Completed Procedures, and a Treatment Plan, in that order from left to right.",447
32,"The outline color differentiates what kind of procedure it is.Note: If you have Hide Material Colors checked in Highlighting Options (the Gear icon in the upper right of the Restorative Charting window), the 'material color' (the green in the above screenshot) will be replaced with the outline color. This may be more useful for you. See How to Set Up Restorative Charting - Hide Material Colors for more detail.Charting ProceduresTo chart a procedure on a tooth, first select either the Patient Chart, Completed Procedures, or Treatment plan, then simply right click the tooth in question. This will bring up the Charting Menu. From there, you can choose the type of procedure you wish to chart. Click OK when you are satisfied with your choice, and the procedure will be added to the chart.Alternatively, if you have a Charting Shortcut you'd like to use, simply click on the tooth you wish to apply a procedure to, and then click on the appropriate Charting Shortcut. For more information on how to set up Charting Shortcuts, please refer to How to Set Up Restorative Charting - Charting Shortcuts.If you wish to chart an item without a tooth selected for the purposes of exams and other procedure codes that aren't tied to a specific tooth, you can click on the ""Chart Without Tooth"" option. This will pull up the Charting Menu.Charting Menu SelectionsYou can find a list of all of the Charting Menu Selections in this article here. Each category can have procedure codes tied to the category by accessing the Charting Code Map on the MacPractice Server computer. Chart HistoryThe Chart History control allows you to cycle through each visit/procedure date to review the progression of a patient's chart over time.The Dental Timeline is assembled by each treatment's procedure date present on the Chart. You can use the ""Chart History"" drop down to choose a date you wish to review, or you can cycle through the dates by using the arrow buttons.It is important to note that newly charted procedures will default to a procedure date of the New Patient Date field, located in the Patient Tab.Clinical Notes TableThe Clinical Note Table is where you can find a textual view for each procedure charted on a selected tooth.",460

If a tooth is selected, the Clinical Notes Table will only display the procedures listed on that particular tooth.You can also use the colored tabs to filter out particular procedures. By default, all filters are active, so all procedures will be included in the table. If you wanted to filter out a set of procedures (for example, all Pre-Existing procedures), you would simply click the tab in question that you wish to filter out.Adding Clinical NotesTo add a Clinical Note to a procedure, simply click on the Clinical Note field and press the tab button. This will bring the selector inside the Note field, and you can type out your note.To add a Clinical Note without a procedure, you can either right click a tooth and select 'Note', or you can click the Plus icon in the upper right of the Clinical Note table (visible in the above gif to the right of the Search bar).Once a Clinical Note has been added, you can lock it from any changes by clicking on the lock icon in the Clinical Note Table. If a Clinical Note is unlocked, you can also change it by clicking the Clinical Note field and pressing tab. Only the user who locked the note can unlock it.If you double click the field, a window will appear displaying each change that had been made to this Clinical Note, and allow you to make in depth changes.If you have a Common Clinical Note set in References > Common Clinical Notes, you can simply type the first few letters of the name or the text within a Common Clinical Note and it will automatically populate in a list.If you delete a Procedure that had a Clinical Note tied to the Procedure, the Clinical Note will be placed in a separate filter named ""Deleted Notes"" to the right of ""Conditions"".",401

They can be very useful for maintenance tasks or when you need to make changes to many accounts to improve your office's workflow.This article will cover some of the most common database utilities used by our offices, and how to utilize them properly.If you are looking for a more complete list of all Database Utilities, please click here.Warning: Before running any Database Utility, you should always ensure the following:You should always make sure you have a current backup. A Backup is NECESSARY before performing database utilities.You should make sure that no one is currently logged into MacPractice.1 Move Patient to Another Account2 Moving A Patient To Their Own Account3 Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing Account3.1 Things to Know4 Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$5 Remove Insurance Portion6 Revert Write-Off To Open Balance7 Update Account Provider8 Update Account Statement Status9 Update Fee Schedule10 Update Patient Fee Schedule11 Update Patient Insurance12 Update Patient Provider13 Update Procedure Type By CodeMove Patient to Another AccountThe ""Move Patient To Another Account"" Utility is used to move a Patient from one Account to either another pre-existing Account, or to move a Patient to a brand new Account. This Utility is great for situations like when a child on one Account has come of age and wants to be on their own Account so the parents aren't paying their medical bills anymore, or in cases where a family splits up but continues to see the practice separately.This Utility cannot be used to merge duplicate patient records together.",417
37,"Unfortunately in those situations you'll need to re-enter the missing information into the appropriate Account, and then archive or delete the invalid Account.Note: Before using the ""Move Patient to Another Account"" Database Utility, a patient needs to have...The Relationship to Primary set to anything BUT ""Self"" in the Patients Ability > Patient Tab.You only can move a patient if they are not the Primary Guarantor of the account.All unapplied balances connected to the account the patient is being moved from should be addressed before running this Utility. Moving A Patient To Their Own AccountGo to the Managers ability and select Database Utilities in the sidebar. In the Database Utilities menu, select select Move Patient To Another Account. You'll be presented with the following fields: Open  The first row is the Account and Patient number, Last Name, and First Name of the Patient who is moving.We strongly advise clicking the Magnifying Glass icon to search for and select the specific Patient. The second row is the Destination Account number, Destination Last Name, and Destination First Name. In this scenario, you'll leave the 2nd row blank as shown in the image, as this indicates that you wish to move the Patient to a new Account. Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window. You'll be reminded to ensure all users are logged out of MacPractice at this time. Click ""OK"" when you have confirmed this is true. Open  You'll then be taken to a prompt to automatically save a Backup. If you have already confirmed you have a fresh backup available as indicated in the beginning in the article, you can cancel this prompt. Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's new account will display with the new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing AccountMoving a Patient To Another Account works exactly the same way as Moving a Patient to their Own Account. The only difference is instead of leaving the 2nd row blank, you'll select a Destination Account instead, as shown in the below screenshot.  Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window.",501

Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's destination account will display with their new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Things to KnowYou may move patients who have financial histories and even remaining balances to their own or to other accounts. However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule. There are actually two utilities that perform this function.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a percentage amount. For example, you can choose to lower all fees by 4.5%. This utility also contains options to control how the utility handles rounding.",466
39,"The image above reflects this utility.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by $: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a given dollar amount. For example, you can choose to raise all fees by a flat $50 rate.As an precaution, you may want to make a duplicate of the fee schedule you intend to run this utility for. You can do this by navigating to the References Ability, selecting the Fee Schedule node, then selecting the Fee Schedule in question. From the Menu, select Edit > Duplicate Fee Schedule.For either Utility, you'll first set whether you want to Raise or Lower, then select the Fee Schedule you wish to adjust.If you're using the percentage utility, you'll need to indicate the percentage amount you want to raise or lower by in the Raise By/Lower By field. Then, select the rounding option. You can choose to round to the nearest dollar amount, whether to round UP to the nearest dollar amount, or not to round at all.For example, if a $100 dollar fee was increased by 4.1%, you'd be left with 104.10.Do Not Round would leave this amount as is.Round to the nearest dollar would round this value DOWN to 104.00.Round up to the nearest dollar would round this value UP to 105.00.If you're using the dollar amount utility, all you need to do is indicate the dollar amount which you want to raise or lower your fees in the Fee Schedule by.Remove Insurance PortionThe Remove Insurance Portion Database Utility allows the user to remove unexpected insurance portions from patients' ledgers. You can choose to run this for a specific account, or for all patients within your database.First, you'll select whether you want to impact all patients in the database, or a specific account. If you select ""For Account"", a field will appear allowing you to enter an account number.Next, you'll set whether you want the utility to hide charges with accurate portions, or charges that aren't on outstanding claims. These are checkboxes; you can either have one, both, or none checked.By clicking ""Show Charges with Insurance Portions"", the Charge Table will populate with all charges with insurance portions. By scrolling right, you can see the status of the Primary and Secondary Insurance, if applicable. You'll also be able to see the Insurance Portion currently on the shown charges.From here, you can simply check and uncheck charges you wish to remove the insurance portion of.",499
40,"Once you're satisfied, clicking Go will run the database utility for those checked charges. Revert Write-Off To Open BalanceThis database utility relates directly to write-off changes made in MacPractice 10.7. Please click here for a detailed article on those write-off changes and how to use the Revert Write-Off To Open Balance utility.Update Account ProviderThe Update Account Provider Database Utility is used to adjust the Account Provider (located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability) from one Provider to another Provider for all patient accounts in the database.First, you'll select the Provider you want to change all your patient accounts FROM in the ""Current Provider"" field.Then, you'll select the Provider you want to change all of your patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Provider"" field.Finally, if you want to adjust the Account Office for all patient accounts, you'll want to check the ""Also Update Office"" checkbox and use the ""Update Office To"" pop up to select the desired office.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Account Statement StatusThis utility updates the ""Where To Send Statements"" and the ""Monthly Statement Options"" fields, located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability, for all patients in your database. This is often used to standardize how statements are sent for your patients.First, you'll select the Statement Status which you wish to transition patient accounts FROM using the ""Current Statement Status"" field.Then you'll select the Statement Status you want to transition patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Status"" field.Finally, you can choose whether you also wish to update the ""Send Statement To"" field for all impacted patient accounts.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Fee ScheduleThe Update Fee Schedule Database Utility is used to update several characteristics of the codes within a Fee Schedule. The Utility will update either all of your Fee Schedules or a specific Fee Schedule, and you can also hone down and change characteristics for a defined range of charge codes.First, you'll define which Fee Schedule you wish to update in the ""Update Fees in Fee Schedule"" pop-up menu. If you want to update all of your Fee Schedules, you can select the ""All Fee Schedules"" option.",456
41,"Then, if there is a specific range of codes you would like to update, set that range in the ""Code Start"" and ""Code End"" fields.Next, you'll use the checkboxes on the left side to choose which characteristics to update, and then use the corresponding pop up menus to choose what to update that characteristic TO. For example, if I wanted to update all fee schedule codes to have Dr. Awesome set as the default provider, I'd check the Default Provider checkbox, then select ""Bob Awesome"" in the Default Provider pop-up.With this utility, you can update:Default ProviderDefault OfficePlace of ServiceType of ServiceDefault RecallProcedure TypeProcedure CategorySet ""Require Co-Pay""Set ""Require Lab""When satisfied, click the Go button to run the Database Utility.Update Patient Fee ScheduleThis particular utility is used to update the Default Fee Schedule, selected in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability, for all patients with a given Fee Schedule selected.First, you need to select what Fee Schedule you want to change FROM by selecting the Fee Schedule in the ""Update All Patients with Fee Schedule"" field.Then, you need to select the Fee Schedule you want to switch these patients TO in the ""To Fee Schedule"" field.Once you're satisfied, click the Go button to run this utility. All patients with the first selected Fee Schedule will then have the second Fee Schedule selected.Update Patient InsuranceThis database utility is used to adjust patients with one insurance carrier and plan to a different insurance carrier and plan.First, you'll select the carrier which you want to change patients FROM in the ""Current Carrier"" field. If there's a specific plan that you want to transition patients from, you can define that in the corresponding ""Plan Name"" field.Then, you can select the carrier which you want to change patients TO in the ""Update to Carrier"" field, along with any specific plan to transition patients to if desired.Finally, if you want to define the start/end dates for each patient, you can do so by checking the ""Update New Insurance's Start Date and Old Insurance's End Date As"" checkbox and then using the date field to define a specific date. This will serve as the new insurance's Start Date and the old insurance's End Date.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the utility.Update Patient ProviderThis Utility is used to update the default Provider for all patients from one provider to another provider. This Provider field is located in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability.",496

The requirements of the Medicaid of one state may differ vastly from the requirements of the Medicaid of another state entirely.Some Medicaid requirements are consistent through all states. These situations apply to state government Medicaid, and may not apply to private Medicaid style plans. This article addresses any potential issues with Medicaid Billing.Subscriber/Patient RelationshipOn eClaims, Medicaid requires that the patient and the subscriber be the same entity. In many cases a parent with one or more children receive Medicaid assistance. When this is the case, one parent or the other may be considered the person financially responsible, Medicaid does not want to see the parent on the eClaim as the subscriber.To properly set this up in MacPractice, maintain the parent's record in the Primary/Secondary tab. In the patient tab of the child's record, set the patient's relationship to parent that has the Medicaid coverage as Child.Open In the Medicaid insurance reference, set the plan type as Medicaid (MC) in the Claims tab, if there is no plan associated to the patient within MacPractice.Open If there is a plan associated to the patient within MacPractice, set the plan type in the insurance reference > Plans tab > Coverage sub-tab.Once these items are set as shown, any eClaim created for the patient will show the patient as the subscriber, as is required by Medicaid, and the claim will contain the subscriber ID as entered in the patient insurance record (Insurance sub-tab of the Patient tab of the Patients ability). {""serverDuration"": 17, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""08452917b23f47d1a95aec31420033fc""}",415

Not all payers will accept secondary eClaims. If there are any questions about which payers will accept secondary eClaims, please contact the payers directly. MacPractice does not have this information.Similar to sending a copy of an EOB with a secondary paper claim, EOB information is required on a secondary eClaim. The EOB Columns need to be turned on and filled in while entering in the payment for the primary claim in the Primary Payment Window. Check the box next to Use EOB Columns.Open After checking Use EOB Columns some additional columns will be added to the payment window for Deductible, Co-Insurance, Copay, Disallowed, Reason Code and ICN. The payment line will turn red and will not save until the EOB columns have been properly filled out.Open  Disallowed AmountThe Disallowed amount is calculated from the total Fee Amount minus the Payment. Entering information in the Deductible, Co-Insurance and Copay columns will reduce the amount in the Disallowed column. If the Disallowed amount is zero, the insurance payment can be saved. If there is any remaining Disallowed Amount, it must be accompanied by an appropriate Reason Code. The Reason Code identifies the reason why the primary Payer did not pay the entire amount, aside from the Deductible, Co-Insurance and Copay. The reason code can be found on the primary payer's EOB.The Disallowed amount is often confused with a write-off. The Disallowed amount is the amount that was not paid after subtracting all payments (patient and insurance) and any insurance deductions.",482
46,"Often times the write-off and the Disallowed amount will be the same amount, but they are separate items. See the formulas for calculating both Disallowed and write-off below:[Fee] - [Paid] - [EOB Columns ""Deductible,"" ""CoInsurance"" and “Copay”] = [Disallowed amount][Fee] - [Allowed] = [Write Off]Some payers use their own set of reason codes to disallow payment, however electronic claims require all reason codes to be sent in a HIPAA-mandated format. A list of HIPAA approved reason codes can be found in the Internet Ability in MacPractice by clicking on Claims Adjustment Reason Codes in the sidebar or by visiting the WPC website. If the payers are not using the HIPAA standard list, the payer specific list will need to be acquired.Each Reason Code will also need to be accompanied by a Group Code. Group Codes are the two digit alpha-characters in front of the Reason Code.With the EOB columns turned on, the payer’s Internal Control Number or ICN can be entered in the last column.Explanation of Claim Adjustment Group CodesCO - Contractual Obligations: This group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjustments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.CR - Corrections and Reversals: This group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim. When correcting a prior claim, CLP02 (claim status code) needs to be 22. See ASC X12N Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Implementation Guide (835) section 2.2.8 for complete information about corrections and reversals.OA - Other Adjustments: This group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.PI - Payer Initiated Reductions: This group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer, for example a medical review or professional review organization adjustments.PR - Patient Responsibility: This group should be used when the adjustments represent an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured.",491

Please note that Time Machine, DropBox, Dolly Drive, or other online backup services do not create database backups. While these services may backup a folder already containing a MacPractice backup, the backup must first be created through MacPractice.Planning a Backup SchemeMacPractice recommends creating a daily backup of MacPractice to the local hard drive and to an external device. We also recommend an off-location backup, such as to a secure cloud location or an external device kept out of office should the worst happen.It is very important to always have a good backup to revert to if there is an emergency.Consider the following when creating a Backup Scheme:LocationAlways store external backups in a secure location, such as a fireproof safe. Select a location that can be accessed if a backup is needed.RotationRotate the backup media for each day of the week your practice is open to reduce the impact of a potential device malfunction.EncryptionShould your server computer or external drives be compromised or lost, encrypting your backups will ensure that any PHI (Protected health Information) is inaccessible without the encryption password. The backup file can never be restored without the encryption password and not even MacPractice Support can bypass encryption security.",485
49,"Always securely store this password in case it is forgotten.RetentionRetain the backups on an external device. Retain at least one backup from the following time periods:The last 2 business weeks or 10 business daysThe end of every monthThe end of every quarterThe end of the fiscal yearDestructionYour Backup Scheme should include a destruction process where older backups are archived, destroyed, or removed. Backups that are deleted, either manually or with the Max Backups feature are not retrievable. Archive any backups that need to be maintained to comply with your Backup Retention Policy (see Retention).Your internal and external drives on the MacPractice Server are limited in backup capacity by the size of the drives and the backups. Regularly removing older backups that do not need to be retained will help maintain space on the MacPractice Server drives and may be necessary in the event of a Low Disk Space or Full Disk error.Server Backup PreferencesOpen You can locate Server Backups in the MacPractice Menu > Preferences > Server Backups. This Preference category is only accessible from the MacPractice Server computer.Within the Server Backups pane of the MacPractice Preferences, you can configure and schedule where and when backups are created.Let’s go over the fields and options in Server Backup Preferences: Default Backup Directory: The Default Backup Directory field sets the location to which automated backups are written. By default, this path is /Library/MacPracticeBackups. To change the Default Backup Directory, click the Choose button next to the Default Backup Directory field and select the location. This backup path can point to any local media, such as an internal or external hard drive. Backups cannot be made directly to non-local media, such as a networking path or directly to a CD.Backup Times: The Backup Times field designates when backups will run for each backup directory.Compression Level: The Compression Level slider controls the compression level for the backups. Lower compression will result in a faster backup creation time, but the final size will be larger. More highly compressed backups will take longer to create, but they will take up less space on your storage medium once finished.Skip Compression Test: The Skip Compression Test checkbox disables the gzip compression test that is performed by default. It is recommended to leave this option unchecked.",464
50,"This test may be used by MacPractice Support to assist in some troubleshooting situations.Encrypt Backups: The Encrypt Backups option encrypts MacPractice backups with secure AES-256 encryption. Enabling this preference requires a password to be entered before the backup can be restored. If the encryption feature is used, it is vital that you remember the password. MacPractice does not have a way to bypass the encrypted password. /warningIt is not possible to restore or decrypt an encrypted backup without the encryption password. MacPractice cannot retrieve the data stored within an encrypted backup. Despite this, we strongly recommend encrypting your backups to ensure your data is secure.Restart Database Server After Backup Completes: This preference, when enabled, will trigger the MySQL server to restart once a backup finishes. This does not exit out of MacPractice, but upon a backup completion any other logged in users may experience slowness or loss of connectivity. If this is enabled, an office must ensure that backups are scheduled outside of operational hours.Encrypting your BackupsYour MacPractice Server's live database is secured via a Security Password which must be entered when starting the server in order to gain access to the database. This ensures that your PHI (Protected Health Information) is secured should an unauthorized party gains access to your server computer. However, your MacPractice Backups are not similarly secured unless you choose to encrypt your backups via Server Backup Preferences.Why is this important?Theft continues to be one of the major causes of healthcare data breaches. If a server computer or storage medium is stolen that contains unsecured data, this would be considered a data breach that requires reporting the breach. Please refer to The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website for more information.Open To encrypt your backups, navigate to the MacPractice Menu > Preferences > Server Backups.Check the Encrypt Backups checkbox.       Enter your password, and re-enter it in the Verify prompt. Important : MacPractice does NOT retain your encryption password! If you misplace or forget this password, MacPractice cannot assist with accessing your encrypted backups. Write this password down and store the password in a secure place!You will be prompted to confirm that password.",458
51,"All backups created after this point will be encrypted with the chosen password.Creating Manual and Automatic BackupsThis section details how to create Manual and Automatic Backups on your Server computer.A MacPractice Backup can only be created on the MacPractice Server. For automatic backups to be created on the server computer, the computer must be powered on and cannot be set to sleep. The MacPractice database must also be running. If the computer is not powered on and active, the backup will not be created.MacPractice does not support creating backups on a Network location. If you need to store backups on the network, we advise that you write a backup to a location on the Server computer, and then once the backup is successfully created, you can then move it to a location on the Network.There are a few steps to address prior to creating backups to ensure you don't run into any issues.Setting Privileges in MacPracticeUsers must have the correct privileges to create a MacPractice backup. These privileges can be managed in the References ability under the User Group Privileges node. Enable the following privileges for the user group that will be responsible for backups management:Access PreferencesAllow Backup DatabaseEdit Backup PreferencesIf any of the above privileges are not enabled, the user group will be unable to create a backup or adjust information in the Server Backup Preferences. Enable the privileges for any user group that will need to create backups. Once this is done, you'll simply need to ensure that the User in question who's going to be managing backups is set to use that User Group in References > Users. macOS User and Security SettingsYou'll want to review and assign the correct User Group permissions for the MacPractice Server computer users to ensure the proper levels of access are assigned to each user. The MacPractice Backup files are only accessible to an Operating System user who is a member of the macpractice_backup user group. To edit the system users, select the Apple menu in the upper left corner of the screen, then select System Preferences followed by Users & Groups.Click the lock in the lower left corner of the System Preferences window to make changes to the groups. Enter the computer administrative username and password.",439
52,"This is the username and password for the computer, not MacPractice.Next, select the macpractice_backup group and check the box next to any computer users that should create or view MacPractice backups on the server. Click the lock icon and close the window to save the changes.For Security Settings, if you intend on having backups written to an external device (and we strongly recommend you do so!) you'll want to enable Full Disk Access for the MacPracticeServerController. You can do this by navigating to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Full Disk Access, and ensuring the ""MacPracticeServerController"" is present in the list and checked, as shown in this screenshot:By doing this, the ServerController will have the necessary access to write to your connected storage devices.Creating a Manual Backup To create a Manual Backup or create an Automatic Backup Scheme, navigate to the MacPractice Menu > Preferences, and locate ""Server Backups"" in the Preferences Sidebar.     Click on the Back Up button in the lower left of the Server Backup Preferences window. This will open a prompt indicating where you'd like to save the backup. By default, this will be located in /Library/MacPracticeBackups. From here, you can select a new location such as an External Drive if desired. When satisfied with the backup location, click the Save Backup button. This will begin creating a full backup of your MacPractice database.Configuring Automatic Backups By default, MacPractice should have a default backup configuration with a fresh database. However, we strongly recommend that you review and configure an automatic backup to meet your individual practice's needs. We recommend that you set a time that you know the Server Computer will be on and won’t be put to sleep, but also a time of the day when you are not needing to extensively use MacPractice, such as outside business hours.By default, backups are written in /Library/MacPracticeBackups, although you can configure automatic backups to be written to any path.A new backup scheme can be created by clicking the plus button, or click the minus button to remove a backup scheme. With the Enabled checkbox checked, a backup will be created at the selected location at the scheduled time and days. When this box is unchecked, the indicated backup scheme will not run.The Source column determines which portion of the database will be stored in the backup.",487
53,"For most practices, you'll want this set to All, as this will back up the entirety of your MacPractice database .Additional backup schemes can be created to backup either the database or attachments separately, but partial backups (data or attachments only) include only the selected portion of a backup. For example, if a database only backup is restored, no attachments will be restored.Database: All MacPractice and patient data, but no Attachment data.Attachments: All images files in MacPractices Digital Radiography/Imaging and Attachments/Images, but no MacPractice and patient data.All: All information, including data and attachments.The Backup Path is the location where automatic backup will be saved. Edit the backup path by double-clicking on the Backup Path line. Select a new location.While a single backup is able to restore your database in the case of a failure, if your primary hard drive that houses the MacPractice database is compromised by hardware failure or other unforeseen circumstances, any backups stored could also be rendered unusable. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you have two backup paths configured at minimum; one on the MacPractice server, and one on an External Device. Max BackupsThe Max Backups column indicates how many backups will be housed at the indicated location for this backup scheme. For example, if this column is set to ""5"" for a backup scheme that runs Monday thru Friday, then MacPractice will house a total of five backups, one for each day a backup was generated. When the number of backups in this location exceeds the Max Backups number, the oldest backup will be removed in favor of the newly generated backup. Due to this, if you want to retain a backup from a particular time frame (such as the beginning of the year), you will need to manually move that backup file to a separate location to avoid losing it.Backup Schemes should never be configured to run at the same time and day. Creating a backup taxes the server resources. Multiple backups should never run simultaneously. If multiple backup schemes are created, adjust the time to allow one backup to start and end before another backup starts. For example, if a backup starts at 6:00 PM and the backup takes at least 30 minutes to complete, set the next backup to start at 7:00 PM.",472

This node appears in several abilities in MacPractice and works the same way throughout. There are a few options for printing Notes; however, certain fields only work when printing from a specific place, such as EMR narratives or appointment data.More information on the Notes ability can be found here.Note: We have updated the MacPractice software to shift the Lists in the drawer into a separate location. You can now find your Lists in the Lists Window, accessible from the Window Menu. You can read more about the changes in Build 11 here.Patients, Schedule & ListsIn the Patients and Schedule Abilities, print a single item for a patient by dragging and dropping the patient name or appointment onto the Note Template in the sidebar. Another method is to select the form and press the plus button on the top of the sidebar, with or without a patient selected, to create the document.Open Print content for a group of patients by using the drawer or a sidebar node. Create a list of patients manually or through the Make List button in a report. Then drag the list from the drawer, or an entire node from the sidebar, onto the title of the note. This will produce one note per patient, such as welcome letters for every new patient appointment.Open EHR, EMR & EDRThe narrative from provider forms can easily be transferred onto Note Templates to create items like referral letters. The EHR, EMR or EDR narratives can be used in a note template. Simply drag the selected completed patient form onto the note template. The note template must have the EHR pull field to work with the EHR template, or the EMR/EDR pull field to work with those abilities. {""serverDuration"": 17, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""ba7e492e8a8545638b32bc41843de5b9""}",487

Please note that Time Machine, DropBox, Dolly Drive, or other online backup services do not create database backups. While these services may backup a folder already containing a MacPractice backup, the backup must first be created through MacPractice.Planning a Backup SchemeMacPractice recommends creating a daily backup of MacPractice to the local hard drive and to an external device. We also recommend an off-location backup, such as to a secure cloud location or an external device kept out of office should the worst happen.It is very important to always have a good backup to revert to if there is an emergency.Consider the following when creating a Backup Scheme:LocationAlways store external backups in a secure location, such as a fireproof safe. Select a location that can be accessed if a backup is needed.RotationRotate the backup media for each day of the week your practice is open to reduce the impact of a potential device malfunction.EncryptionShould your server computer or external drives be compromised or lost, encrypting your backups will ensure that any PHI (Protected health Information) is inaccessible without the encryption password. The backup file can never be restored without the encryption password and not even MacPractice Support can bypass encryption security.",490
56,"Always securely store this password in case it is forgotten.RetentionRetain the backups on an external device. Retain at least one backup from the following time periods:The last 2 business weeks or 10 business daysThe end of every monthThe end of every quarterThe end of the fiscal yearDestructionYour Backup Scheme should include a destruction process where older backups are archived, destroyed, or removed. Backups that are deleted, either manually or with the Max Backups feature are not retrievable. Archive any backups that need to be maintained to comply with your Backup Retention Policy (see Retention).Your internal and external drives on the MacPractice Server are limited in backup capacity by the size of the drives and the backups. Regularly removing older backups that do not need to be retained will help maintain space on the MacPractice Server drives and may be necessary in the event of a Low Disk Space or Full Disk error.Server Backup PreferencesOpen You can locate Server Backups in the MacPractice Menu > Preferences > Server Backups. This Preference category is only accessible from the MacPractice Server computer.Within the Server Backups pane of the MacPractice Preferences, you can configure and schedule where and when backups are created.Let’s go over the fields and options in Server Backup Preferences: Default Backup Directory: The Default Backup Directory field sets the location to which automated backups are written. By default, this path is /Library/MacPracticeBackups. To change the Default Backup Directory, click the Choose button next to the Default Backup Directory field and select the location. This backup path can point to any local media, such as an internal or external hard drive. Backups cannot be made directly to non-local media, such as a networking path or directly to a CD.Backup Times: The Backup Times field designates when backups will run for each backup directory.Compression Level: The Compression Level slider controls the compression level for the backups. Lower compression will result in a faster backup creation time, but the final size will be larger. More highly compressed backups will take longer to create, but they will take up less space on your storage medium once finished.Skip Compression Test: The Skip Compression Test checkbox disables the gzip compression test that is performed by default. It is recommended to leave this option unchecked.",464
57,"This test may be used by MacPractice Support to assist in some troubleshooting situations.Encrypt Backups: The Encrypt Backups option encrypts MacPractice backups with secure AES-256 encryption. Enabling this preference requires a password to be entered before the backup can be restored. If the encryption feature is used, it is vital that you remember the password. MacPractice does not have a way to bypass the encrypted password. /warningIt is not possible to restore or decrypt an encrypted backup without the encryption password. MacPractice cannot retrieve the data stored within an encrypted backup. Despite this, we strongly recommend encrypting your backups to ensure your data is secure.Restart Database Server After Backup Completes: This preference, when enabled, will trigger the MySQL server to restart once a backup finishes. This does not exit out of MacPractice, but upon a backup completion any other logged in users may experience slowness or loss of connectivity. If this is enabled, an office must ensure that backups are scheduled outside of operational hours.Encrypting your BackupsYour MacPractice Server's live database is secured via a Security Password which must be entered when starting the server in order to gain access to the database. This ensures that your PHI (Protected Health Information) is secured should an unauthorized party gains access to your server computer. However, your MacPractice Backups are not similarly secured unless you choose to encrypt your backups via Server Backup Preferences.Why is this important?Theft continues to be one of the major causes of healthcare data breaches. If a server computer or storage medium is stolen that contains unsecured data, this would be considered a data breach that requires reporting the breach. Please refer to The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website for more information.Open To encrypt your backups, navigate to the MacPractice Menu > Preferences > Server Backups.Check the Encrypt Backups checkbox.       Enter your password, and re-enter it in the Verify prompt. Important : MacPractice does NOT retain your encryption password! If you misplace or forget this password, MacPractice cannot assist with accessing your encrypted backups. Write this password down and store the password in a secure place!You will be prompted to confirm that password.",458
58,"All backups created after this point will be encrypted with the chosen password.Creating Manual and Automatic BackupsThis section details how to create Manual and Automatic Backups on your Server computer.A MacPractice Backup can only be created on the MacPractice Server. For automatic backups to be created on the server computer, the computer must be powered on and cannot be set to sleep. The MacPractice database must also be running. If the computer is not powered on and active, the backup will not be created.MacPractice does not support creating backups on a Network location. If you need to store backups on the network, we advise that you write a backup to a location on the Server computer, and then once the backup is successfully created, you can then move it to a location on the Network.There are a few steps to address prior to creating backups to ensure you don't run into any issues.Setting Privileges in MacPracticeUsers must have the correct privileges to create a MacPractice backup. These privileges can be managed in the References ability under the User Group Privileges node. Enable the following privileges for the user group that will be responsible for backups management:Access PreferencesAllow Backup DatabaseEdit Backup PreferencesIf any of the above privileges are not enabled, the user group will be unable to create a backup or adjust information in the Server Backup Preferences. Enable the privileges for any user group that will need to create backups. Once this is done, you'll simply need to ensure that the User in question who's going to be managing backups is set to use that User Group in References > Users. macOS User and Security SettingsYou'll want to review and assign the correct User Group permissions for the MacPractice Server computer users to ensure the proper levels of access are assigned to each user. The MacPractice Backup files are only accessible to an Operating System user who is a member of the macpractice_backup user group. To edit the system users, select the Apple menu in the upper left corner of the screen, then select System Preferences followed by Users & Groups.Click the lock in the lower left corner of the System Preferences window to make changes to the groups. Enter the computer administrative username and password.",439
59,"This is the username and password for the computer, not MacPractice.Next, select the macpractice_backup group and check the box next to any computer users that should create or view MacPractice backups on the server. Click the lock icon and close the window to save the changes.For Security Settings, if you intend on having backups written to an external device (and we strongly recommend you do so!) you'll want to enable Full Disk Access for the MacPracticeServerController. You can do this by navigating to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Full Disk Access, and ensuring the ""MacPracticeServerController"" is present in the list and checked, as shown in this screenshot:By doing this, the ServerController will have the necessary access to write to your connected storage devices.Creating a Manual Backup To create a Manual Backup or create an Automatic Backup Scheme, navigate to the MacPractice Menu > Preferences, and locate ""Server Backups"" in the Preferences Sidebar.     Click on the Back Up button in the lower left of the Server Backup Preferences window. This will open a prompt indicating where you'd like to save the backup. By default, this will be located in /Library/MacPracticeBackups. From here, you can select a new location such as an External Drive if desired. When satisfied with the backup location, click the Save Backup button. This will begin creating a full backup of your MacPractice database.Configuring Automatic Backups By default, MacPractice should have a default backup configuration with a fresh database. However, we strongly recommend that you review and configure an automatic backup to meet your individual practice's needs. We recommend that you set a time that you know the Server Computer will be on and won’t be put to sleep, but also a time of the day when you are not needing to extensively use MacPractice, such as outside business hours.By default, backups are written in /Library/MacPracticeBackups, although you can configure automatic backups to be written to any path.A new backup scheme can be created by clicking the plus button, or click the minus button to remove a backup scheme. With the Enabled checkbox checked, a backup will be created at the selected location at the scheduled time and days. When this box is unchecked, the indicated backup scheme will not run.The Source column determines which portion of the database will be stored in the backup.",487
60,"For most practices, you'll want this set to All, as this will back up the entirety of your MacPractice database .Additional backup schemes can be created to backup either the database or attachments separately, but partial backups (data or attachments only) include only the selected portion of a backup. For example, if a database only backup is restored, no attachments will be restored.Database: All MacPractice and patient data, but no Attachment data.Attachments: All images files in MacPractices Digital Radiography/Imaging and Attachments/Images, but no MacPractice and patient data.All: All information, including data and attachments.The Backup Path is the location where automatic backup will be saved. Edit the backup path by double-clicking on the Backup Path line. Select a new location.While a single backup is able to restore your database in the case of a failure, if your primary hard drive that houses the MacPractice database is compromised by hardware failure or other unforeseen circumstances, any backups stored could also be rendered unusable. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you have two backup paths configured at minimum; one on the MacPractice server, and one on an External Device. Max BackupsThe Max Backups column indicates how many backups will be housed at the indicated location for this backup scheme. For example, if this column is set to ""5"" for a backup scheme that runs Monday thru Friday, then MacPractice will house a total of five backups, one for each day a backup was generated. When the number of backups in this location exceeds the Max Backups number, the oldest backup will be removed in favor of the newly generated backup. Due to this, if you want to retain a backup from a particular time frame (such as the beginning of the year), you will need to manually move that backup file to a separate location to avoid losing it.Backup Schemes should never be configured to run at the same time and day. Creating a backup taxes the server resources. Multiple backups should never run simultaneously. If multiple backup schemes are created, adjust the time to allow one backup to start and end before another backup starts. For example, if a backup starts at 6:00 PM and the backup takes at least 30 minutes to complete, set the next backup to start at 7:00 PM.",472

Not all payers will accept secondary eClaims. If there are any questions about which payers will accept secondary eClaims, please contact the payers directly. MacPractice does not have this information.Similar to sending a copy of an EOB with a secondary paper claim, EOB information is required on a secondary eClaim. The EOB Columns need to be turned on and filled in while entering in the payment for the primary claim in the Primary Payment Window. Check the box next to Use EOB Columns.Open After checking Use EOB Columns some additional columns will be added to the payment window for Deductible, Co-Insurance, Copay, Disallowed, Reason Code and ICN. The payment line will turn red and will not save until the EOB columns have been properly filled out.Open  Disallowed AmountThe Disallowed amount is calculated from the total Fee Amount minus the Payment. Entering information in the Deductible, Co-Insurance and Copay columns will reduce the amount in the Disallowed column. If the Disallowed amount is zero, the insurance payment can be saved. If there is any remaining Disallowed Amount, it must be accompanied by an appropriate Reason Code. The Reason Code identifies the reason why the primary Payer did not pay the entire amount, aside from the Deductible, Co-Insurance and Copay. The reason code can be found on the primary payer's EOB.The Disallowed amount is often confused with a write-off. The Disallowed amount is the amount that was not paid after subtracting all payments (patient and insurance) and any insurance deductions. Often times the write-off and the Disallowed amount will be the same amount, but they are separate items.",495
64,"See the formulas for calculating both Disallowed and write-off below:[Fee] - [Paid] - [EOB Columns ""Deductible,"" ""CoInsurance"" and “Copay”] = [Disallowed amount][Fee] - [Allowed] = [Write Off]Some payers use their own set of reason codes to disallow payment, however electronic claims require all reason codes to be sent in a HIPAA-mandated format. A list of HIPAA approved reason codes can be found in the Internet Ability in MacPractice by clicking on Claims Adjustment Reason Codes in the sidebar or by visiting the WPC website. If the payers are not using the HIPAA standard list, the payer specific list will need to be acquired.Each Reason Code will also need to be accompanied by a Group Code. Group Codes are the two digit alpha-characters in front of the Reason Code.With the EOB columns turned on, the payer’s Internal Control Number or ICN can be entered in the last column.Explanation of Claim Adjustment Group CodesCO - Contractual Obligations: This group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjustments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.CR - Corrections and Reversals: This group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim. When correcting a prior claim, CLP02 (claim status code) needs to be 22. See ASC X12N Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Implementation Guide (835) section 2.2.8 for complete information about corrections and reversals.OA - Other Adjustments: This group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.PI - Payer Initiated Reductions: This group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer, for example a medical review or professional review organization adjustments.PR - Patient Responsibility: This group should be used when the adjustments represent an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured. This group would typically be used for deductible and copay adjustments.EOB columns will need to be filled out for each procedure being submitted on the eClaim.",500

Networking - IP Addresses - MacPractice HelpDesk - Confluence SpacesAppsTemplatesCreateMacPractice HelpDeskAll contentCalendarsSpace settingsContentMacPractice HelpDeskSecurity and NetworkingNetworking - IP AddressesNetworking - IP AddressesDylan NighOwned by Dylan NighLast updated: Nov 03, 20234 min readLoading data...This article covers what IP Addresses are, and how they relate to MacPractice and other services. Understanding what an IP address is will be very important when considering how to connect a MacPractice client to a MacPractice server.1 Explanation2 Static and Dynamic IP Addresses3 Dynamic DNS ConfigurationExplanationAn IP address identifies a computer on a network. You can consider an IP address to be similar to the street address of a business or a home in real-world terms.IP Addresses are made up of four numbers separated by periods. 255.255.255.255 is a fake example of an External IP address. There are two types of IP addresses, Internal (Local) and External (Global or Real-World).An Internal IP address identifies a computer on an Internal Network, whereas an External IP identifies a computer across the Internet. Most computers on an Internal Network will have individual Internal IP addresses, but the Internal Network as a whole will share one External IP address.To continue the analogy of the street address, the street address of an apartment complex is like an External IP address, indicating where in the world the network resides. An Internal IP address would be like the apartment number within the larger apartment complex, telling you where in the ""building"" your device resides.Internal IP Addresses usually lead with the same digits if they are on the same network. One common example is 192.168.x.x. These leading digits may change with the router or network depending on a variety of factors.When connecting a MacPractice Client to a MacPractice Server, you need the Server's Internal IP address so the client knows where on the network to look for the device.Static and Dynamic IP AddressesIP Addresses can be either static or dynamic.A Dynamic Internal IP address is typically automatically assigned by your router or switch. Generally, dynamically assigned IP addresses of any machine on the Internal Network are subject to change when the router or network is reset, the operating system is updated, after a power outage, and so on.An Internal Static IP address allows a device to maintain the same IP address on the network at all times.",488
68,"A Static Internal IP address is preferred for the MacPractice server as it will prevent the need to reset the server IP address in the client login settings by ensuring that this address does not change on the server. If you choose to, you can also assign Static Internal IP addresses to the other devices on your network.Your office's External IP address is assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Unless your office has requested and paid for a Static External IP address through your ISP, this is most likely a Dynamic External IP address subject to change at any time. MacPractice abilities such as the iPad and iPhone interfaces and Patient Portal require Static External IP addresses to function reliably. Use of these services may require you to contact your ISP to have a Static External IP address assigned to your office.Contact MacPractice Support to learn more and to ascertain whether you would need this sort of configuration for your office. Keep in mind that MacPractice Support is not able to configure your network, as this would require the aid of a network specialist that is familiar with the specific needs of your office.  Dynamic DNS ConfigurationMacPractice recommends using a static IP address with Patient Portal. If you choose not to use a static IP address, you will need to set up a dynamic DNS system that uses update software to keep your hostname's IP address up-to-date. A static IP purchased through your ISP will never change, whereas a dynamic DNS system periodically checks for a change to a dynamic IP address, then maps the new address to the hostname established with the dynamic DNS provider.Dynamic DNS systems are subject to outages of the DNS provider, so you must familiarize yourself with the reporting procedures, scheduled outages, and terms of a dynamic DNS provider before selecting to use their service.MacPractice cannot configure or support a dynamic DNS system, nor can we recommend a dynamic DNS provider. However, the basic steps for setting up such a system are similar amongst most dynamic DNS system configurations. If you are not comfortable with the instructions below, consult a networking professional or your dynamic DNS provider for assistance.First, create an account and hostname with a dynamic DNS provider of your choice.Next, install the provided dynamic DNS update software. This may be done on the MacPractice server. Consult the DNS provider for formal configuration instructions and options.",457

If you utilize eClaims, you'll want to refer to the eClaims article about Worker's Comp Claims instead.Warning: While we've done our best to provide a general idea of what is needed, each insurance company has different requirements for how worker's comp claims are handled. Regardless of any instructions given here, you will have to work with the payer to determine how they want worker's comp claims to be submitted.MacPractice Support is available to assist with ensuring particular information is included or formatted properly, but we cannot assist with determining what is required on a particular claim.Insurance ReferenceWhen setting up worker's comp insurance companies or specific plans, you will want to make sure the plan type is set to 'Worker's Compensation'. This will ensure that the Worker's Comp claims operate as expected; filling in the Employer's name instead of the Primary's name as the subscriber. Open Patient AbilityWhen filling out information on patient and primary tabs, this information can vary based on the payer. MOST companies would like to see the Employer listed on the claim as the subscriber (for example, in box 4 of the CMS 1500 form). The patient would then be listed as the employee as it is in this example on box 2. Check with the insurance carrier for any specific requirements.Open The plan type is what controls which name is used as patient and subscriber. When using the Worker's Comp plan type, you may leave the account's primary guarantor in the Primary tab. Some offices may choose to enter the Employer as the primary person; however, it is not required for the claim information to print correctly. On the Primary/Secondary Tab, enter the employer and the employer's Worker's Compensation Insurance below.",472

The paperwork area is most commonly used for Worker's Comp claims but can also be used to indicate other types of attachments corresponding to electronic claims. Payers have different requirements on how they want to receive paperwork, so any questions on how to send the information should be directed towards your carriers.Open To add a record to the Resource tab, click the green plus button. This will cause a small sheet to drop from the top edge of the window. In this sheet, select Paperwork as the resource type and click Add.Open  Once a Paperwork record is added to the table below, twist it down by clicking on the triangle to the left of the record. This will bring down the Attachment Control Number, Attachment Transmission Code, and the Attachment Type Code fields.The Attachment Control Number allows you to indicate an attachment trace number or confirmation number. To edit the attachment control number, double click in the Value area next to the attachment control number. The field will then be highlighted and you can begin typing your attachment control number.The attachment control number is required if the attachment transmission code is anything other than ""Available on Request"". You will need to speak to the insurance carrier for instructions on how they wish to see any sent attachments.On eClaims, this information populates the PWK06 element of the 2300 Loop. It is free form entry, and appears in the element just as it is entered in the Resource tab. The Attachment Transmission Code indicates the method by which the attachment is being presented to the insurance carrier.",485

When sending information to MacPractice that contains patient data, such as an insurance card, it is necessary to send this informations as an encrypted attachment.In order to encrypt an image use the following steps:Open the image in preview.Open In Preview go to File > Export as PDFOpen You will then see a window prompting you to save the image. You will want to click the Show Details button.In the box that pops down, check the box to Encrypt. You will need to create a password here. The recipient will need this password to open the file.  Once this is added click Save.The file should then appear in the location that you saved it, however it should show as a locked PDF. This will be what you will add to your email.You will want to send two emails. The first email should contain the file and an explanation that a second email will be sent containing the password to open the encrypted file. The second email should contain the password to open the file.Another good practice is to tell the recipient the file's password while on the phone with them, rather than in a second email. This reduces the risk of unwanted recipients opening the file should another party inadvertently receive it.When the recipient attempts to open the encrypted document they will be promoted to enter the password:The recipient will then be able to enter the password here to open/view the document. {""serverDuration"": 17, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""56acae255b0c4c8292ebc83acae42d84""}",423

We're very excited to present this new feature (and several more!) to you, but in order to incorporate this feature we had to make some structural changes to how ledger information is stored and accounted for in the software.Our goal is to ensure that your data's integrity is assured when updating, despite these structural changes. In order to meet this goal, we need every office on MacPractice Build 7.3 that intends on updating beyond Build 7.3 to run the Accounting Migration Report.Running The Accounting Migration ReportFirst, you'll need to be on the Server Computer.You'll want to make sure that you have a fresh backup available.You'll need to set aside plenty of time. This report simulates the process of updating to a new build of MacPractice, and so will take the same amount of time as a large update. We recommend running it overnight.Finally, you'll need to ensure that all users are logged out of MacPractice.This Report is located in the Managers Ability, under the Database Utilities node. It is called ""Run Accounting Migration Report"".  Open  Once you've located the report, all you'll need to do is click the Go button in the lower right. You will be asked to log out of any terminal or client computers. Next the utility will ask you to save a backup. You may choose to skip this by choosing ""Cancel"" or run a fresh backup by choosing ""Save Backup"" after selecting the location you would like to write the backup to. Lastly, you will then be prompted to authenticate. All you'll need there is the OS Username and Password for the Server Computer. Once you have authenticated, the migration report will begin.",455

However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule. There are actually two utilities that perform this function.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a percentage amount. For example, you can choose to lower all fees by 4.5%. This utility also contains options to control how the utility handles rounding.",466

For example, you can choose to raise all fees by a flat $50 rate.As an precaution, you may want to make a duplicate of the fee schedule you intend to run this utility for. You can do this by navigating to the References Ability, selecting the Fee Schedule node, then selecting the Fee Schedule in question. From the Menu, select Edit > Duplicate Fee Schedule.For either Utility, you'll first set whether you want to Raise or Lower, then select the Fee Schedule you wish to adjust.If you're using the percentage utility, you'll need to indicate the percentage amount you want to raise or lower by in the Raise By/Lower By field.

Please click here for a detailed article on those write-off changes and how to use the Revert Write-Off To Open Balance utility.Update Account ProviderThe Update Account Provider Database Utility is used to adjust the Account Provider (located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability) from one Provider to another Provider for all patient accounts in the database.First, you'll select the Provider you want to change all your patient accounts FROM in the ""Current Provider"" field.Then, you'll select the Provider you want to change all of your patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Provider"" field.Finally, if you want to adjust the Account Office for all patient accounts, you'll want to check the ""Also Update Office"" checkbox and use the ""Update Office To"" pop up to select the desired office.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Account Statement StatusThis utility updates the ""Where To Send Statements"" and the ""Monthly Statement Options"" fields, located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability, for all patients in your database. This is often used to standardize how statements are sent for your patients.First, you'll select the Statement Status which you wish to transition patient accounts FROM using the ""Current Statement Status"" field.Then you'll select the Statement Status you want to transition patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Status"" field.Finally, you can choose whether you also wish to update the ""Send Statement To"" field for all impacted patient accounts.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Fee ScheduleThe Update Fee Schedule Database Utility is used to update several characteristics of the codes within a Fee Schedule. The Utility will update either all of your Fee Schedules or a specific Fee Schedule, and you can also hone down and change characteristics for a defined range of charge codes.First, you'll define which Fee Schedule you wish to update in the ""Update Fees in Fee Schedule"" pop-up menu. If you want to update all of your Fee Schedules, you can select the ""All Fee Schedules"" option.",456

For a secondary claim to correctly process, EOB information from the primary payer needs to be included on the claim; even if the primary paid 0.00. There are usually a couple of things that will flag this rejection. Most notably would be not having 'Use EOB Columns' checked on the Primary Payment. It is also possible that more than one payment is tied to the charges causing the calculations to be off.Please see Creating Secondary eClaims, for assistance with secondary eClaim creation.Secondary Claim - Adjudication/Date Claim PaidRejection Messages:COB claim balancing failed.

The results of each report is visible in the eClaim Status Panel of the associated claim. However, at some point there may be a need to view reports directly, apart from what is viewable while in the eClaims Node.The following elements within the Reports Node are used to interact directly with the eClaim reports. Their descriptions are described below:Reports Node - ExpandedIf unarchived eClaim reports are present in MacPractice, a triangle will be visible next to the Reports Node, in the sidebar. Clicking on this triangle will expand the contents of the Reports Node, making them viewable to the user.Open If the user clicks on the individual report within the node, the contents of that report will be viewable for the user.Note that it is difficult to determine which report belongs to which claims, as there will be nothing in the file names of reports to indicate this. If the user wants to view claim reports for a specific patient, from within the Reports Node, the user can type the patient's name in the search bar. This will bring all reports that contain information for that patient's claims. Keep in mind that most reports contain status information of multiple claims, for multiple patients. Even when the report comes up that contains the desired patient's information, the user will most likely need to scroll through the report to find that specific patient's claim status information.Receive ButtonThe Receive Button is used to manually receive reports.",494
221,"When there are no claims that can be sent, but there are claims in Sent that are awaiting reports, the user can select the Reports Node in the sidebar and click the Receive Button. This will force MacPractice to send a request to the partner clearinghouse, Change Healthcare, to download any outstanding reports. This will also receive any ERAsthat are awaiting download from the office.After the user clicks the Receive Button, while MacPractice is retrieving reports from the clearinghouse, MacPractice will be unusable for a short time. During this time, the bottom frame of the eClaims window will state ""Receiving report data. Please wait..."". Once MacPractice has downloaded all available reports, a Transfer Results Window will appear.The Transfer Results Window will list the names of all reports and all ERAs that have been received during this Receive Reports session. It will also note how many claims have been moved to the Accepted Bin and how many have been moved to the Rejected Bin. If a multiple reports come in for a single claim, every time a different report affects that claim, it will be counted in the number of claims affected.For example: if a claim was accepted by the clearinghouse and rejected by the payer, but nobody has received reports in a while, the clearinghouse rejection will first apply to the claim, then the payer rejection will apply to the claim. The Transfer Results Window will note that 1 claim has been moved to accepted and 1 claim has been moved to rejected. It appears in the window that two claims have been moved, but in fact it was the same claim, which has been affected twice in the same Receive Reports session. The same can happen if multiple Accepted or Rejected responses come in for the same claim.If the user clicks OK, the window will disappear.If ERAs have come in during the Receive Reports session, the Print ERAs Button will be usable at this time. If no ERAs were received, the Print ERAs Button will be grayed out. Clicking this button will bring down a print window.The Print Window will offer several options to the user. Select the options in this window that will work best for the office's needs.Archive ButtoneClaim reports cannot be deleted from MacPractice. They can only be archived.",499
222,"The Archive Button allows the user to archive older reports. Archiving does not untie the reports from their associated claims. It only removes the reports from the Reports Node.The user can twist down the Reports Node and select each report individually and press the Archive Button. There will be no prompt or warning when reports are archived this way. The report will simply disappear from the Reports Node. Only one report at a time can be archived by this method.If the user highlights the Reports Node itself and presses the Archive Button, a sheet will drop down. In this sheet, the user needs only to simply check the box next to the items they wish to archive. Clicking ""Check all rows"" will place a checkmark next to every item in the sheet. Once all desired items are checked, the user can then press the Archive Button. This will archive all records that were selected in the sheet. Unarchive ButtonReports that have been archived can be retrieved, by using the Unarchive Button. To unarchive reports, simply press the Unarchive Button.After the Unarchive Button is pressed, a sheet will drop down, containing a list of all archived reports. From here, the user can check the box next to the reports they wish to retrieve, or they can opt to select all of the items in the sheet by clicking the ""check all rows"" box at the bottom of the sheet. Once all desired reports are checked, the user need only press the Retrieve Button at the bottom of the sheet. This will return all selected reports to the Reports Node in the eClaims Ability.'Template To Receive From' Pop-up MenuSome offices have more than one ProxyMed template. This is the template that is used for Change Healthcare claims. The template can be renamed, often renamed for specific doctors, to keep their claim submissions separated.If a user wishes to only download reports that tie to a specific eClaims template, the user can click on the 'Template To Receive From' menu and select just that template.",437

To create claims in the ledger, select a charge or series of charges, go to the Print menu and select Create Insurance Claim.Keep in mind that a paper claim will not necessarily reflect the information that will appear on an eClaim. Many payers have very different requirements for eClaims than they do for paper claims. Printing out a paper claim to verify information regarding an eClaim will not be helpful, because the information won't always match between the two media.Open In the claim creation window, change the Form/Template pop-up menu to the eClaims template.Open  If you need any additional assistance creating claims in the ledger, please click here. If you would like to use the New Claims Manager to print your claims in bulk, please review the Claim Manager documentation here.You should also set your default eClaims template in the Preferences window if you have not already done so. Go to the MacPractice menu and select Preferences. Select Forms in the sidebar, and in the Default eClaim Template pop up menu, select your template.Many places of business operate as more than one billing entity, referred to as “Offices” in MacPractice. Usually each office requires its own eClaims template. If this is the case, we recommend that a default template be set within each office reference.When a default template is set in the office reference, the template set in the office reference will override whichever template is set in the Forms Preferences. With this set, the claim creation window will default to the eClaim template that is set in the office reference associated to the procedures on the claim.You may also decide to default your insurance companies to select electronic claims for you automatically.",482
227,"This is controlled by your Insurance Company reference, by setting the eClaims Template and Default Forms pop up menus near the bottom right corner.This setting will override whatever is set in the office reference. If the place of business has more than one billing entity, it is recommended that the insurance reference default eClaim template be ‘None’. If both of these pop-up menus are set to ‘None’, the payer will default to the eClaims template set in the office reference. If there is no default eClaim template set in the office reference, the payer will default to the default claim form in Preferences > Forms.If you would like this payer to always be sent on paper claims, you may set the Default Form to your paper claim form, leave the eClaims Template set to ‘None’, and the insurance company will use the paper form by default. If the eClaims Template on the Insurance Company is set, this will override the Default Form and the insurance will default to the eClaim.There are several Database Utilities that will allow you to set the form or template status for all insurance companies as a whole. Note that Database Utilities can only be performed on the server computer. Please review the Database Utilities documentation for more information.Once you have created your eClaim, it will be given an initial status of either ""Ready"" or ""Invalid.""You can view the status in the Ledger in the Status column.The status will automatically update as you work with claims in the eClaims ability and post payments to claims. You may double click on an eClaim in the ledger to go directly to that claim in the eClaims ability for review. You may also manually change the status of an eClaim in the ledger by selecting it, then going to the Other menu and selecting ""Set Claim Status _____."" Please use this ability with caution, as the status in the ledger is the same status in the eClaims ability, and changing the status incorrectly may prevent the claim from being sent or processed.The status of an eClaim can be changed in the ledger, from the ""Other"" menu.

Many payers have very different requirements for eClaims than they do for paper claims. Printing out a paper claim to verify information regarding an eClaim will not be helpful, because the information won't always match between the two media. 1 Before you can send eClaims2 eClaims Ability Overview3 As you work with eClaims4 Changing eClaim Status5 Selecting a Claim to Edit or Review DetailsAdditional Articles:https://macpractice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MPHelpDesk/pages/74645551 https://macpractice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MPHelpDesk/pages/74645561 https://macpractice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MPHelpDesk/pages/74874937  Before you can send eClaimsOpen The eClaims ability in MacPractice allows you to send, track and manage electronic claims.Before you can send electronic claims, you will need to begin the enrollment process with one of our clearinghouses. Please contact the MacPractice Enrollment department at 877-220-8418 if you have not enrolled for eClaims. After your enrollment, you will receive an eClaims training, during which the eClaims trainer will install and set up your eClaims template. This documentation has been written to provide you with additional information after your eClaims template has been installed and your eClaims training has been completed. This document is in no way meant to replace eClaims training. Before training, MacPractice recommends that you familiarize yourself with the MacPractice Ledger, and make sure you know how to enter procedures, post payments and create paper claims. Please review the Ledger documentation if you need assistance with this process.eClaims Ability OverviewOpen The eClaims ability is divided up into 3 panes. The area along the top contains 7 different tabs listing different claim statuses. Your claims will be listed under the tab corresponding to the appropriate status (A).",482
257,"When you have a claim selected, the area near the bottom left will display the claim details, listing all information on the eClaim (B). The area on the bottom right will display the status updates and history for the selected claim, with the most recent information listed first (C). You will utilize this area to review problems with invalid and rejected claims, and can also use this information to see exactly when claims were sent, received, and so on.As you work with eClaimsAs you work with your electronic claims, they will be moved from tab to tab in the eClaims ability as their status changes. Each tab will also display the number of claims within the tab next to the name. If you do not see a number, it simply means MacPractice is currently loading that information. If you are in Many mode (that is, you don't have a patient selected), you will see all patients' claims of a given status within the tab.If you are in One mode (that is, you have a patient selected), you will only see that patient's claims. The number next to the status name will also show you how many claims you are viewing out of the total number of claims in that status. In the example below, we are viewing 2 out of 42 invalid claims. If a bin contains only s claims for other patients than the one that is selected, the bin will appear empty to the viewer. The numbers in the title tab will indicate there are claims in the bin, even if they cannot be viewed. Changing eClaim StatusYou may manually change the claim status in the eClaims ability by selecting the claim, and using the ""Move To"" pop-up menu (A). Changing the status in the eClaims ability will also change the status in the patient's ledger as well. You should take caution when manually changing claim statuses however, as changing the status incorrectly may prevent the claim from being sent or processed.If you have multiple templates in your database, you can also filter your eClaims list by the template, by selecting the template in the ""Template Filter"" pop-up menu (B). You cannot use this feature to change the template that the claim was created with. If you created a claim with the wrong template in error, you will need to create a new claim using the correct template.",474
258,"If the original claim has not been sent, you can delete it; if it has been sent to the clearinghouse, you should close or archive the original claim.Selecting a Claim to Edit or Review DetailsSelect a claim in the upper pane to edit the claim or review the claim details. With a claim selected, the bottom left hand area will show you the current information listed on the claim, including the provider, patient, primary, and procedure information, among others. This area should not generally be used to edit the claim information, because it does not fix the source of the problem. MacPractice recommends making the change in the patient's record, and simply fetching the updated claim information in the eClaim itself by clicking the Rebuild button. Utilizing this method will fix the source of the problem, so that it does not occur again. If you make the change in the claim data in the eClaims ability, it will only temporarily fix the issue on the selected claim. Rebuilding the claim at any point will remove any data you have manually entered into the claim details.There are occasions in which the Rebuild button won't update new information. For further details on when not to use the Rebuild button, click here.Claims will be assigned a status when they are initially created. The initial claim status will either be Invalid or Ready. Ready claims are claims that pass MacPractice validation and are ready to be set to the clearinghouse for transmission. Invalid claims have failed MacPractice validation and need to be reviewed before they can be sent. To review an invalid claim, select it in the eClaims ability. The pane in the bottom right hand corner will show you details about why the claim is invalid.Missing information in the patient's demographics, the insurance company information or the provider's credentials could potentially cause an invalid claim, among other things. The types of invalid messages you receive will depend on your template. For example, the ProxyMed template for medical claims submitters will stop claims that do not have any diagnosis codes, but the EHG template for dental submitters will not.Invalid claims will also be highlighted in red in the table above, and the area where the information is invalid will be highlighted in red in the claim data section. MacPractice recommends changing the source of the problem and the rebuilding the claim instead of manually fixing the information here.Once you fix all issues with your invalid claim, select it and click the Rebuild button.",489

It is recommended that claims not be left to sit in this bin for too long. It is a good idea to move claims that are over a few months old to Archived.Open Claims that are in the Archived Bin will not be parsed when entering the eClaims Ability. They will only be parsed when the Archived Tab is selected within the eClaims Ability. Claims in all other bins will be parsed upon entering the eClaims Ability.The parsing of claims doesn't take much time when there are only a few unarchived eClaims. However, the claims can gather quickly in other bins. The more claims that are parsed when entering the eClaims Ability, the longer it will take for the ability to load.The only way that eClaims can be moved to the Archived Bin is by user interaction. The claims can be moved, either by using the ""Move To"" pop-up at the top of the eClaims Window, or by selecting the claim in the patient's ledger and using the ""Other"" pop-up menu.In order to unarchive an eClaim, the user simply needs to either manually move the claim from the Archived bin or rebuild the eClaim. The former method will move the claim to whatever bin the user wishes. The latter method will either move the claim to Ready or Invalid, depending on whether the eClaim passes MacPractice validations or not. {""serverDuration"": 37, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""c701268007d242fcaa2455c1dd665ad7""}",442

268,"The D1351 Sealant charted in the example above displays Current Location: Sealants -> D1351.Before setting up the Charting Code Map, a Fee Schedule with the charting fee codes should be created to be used to add the procedures you'll need to populate the Charting Code Map.Mapping CodesTo place a code within a category, simply click and drag codes from the Fee Schedule Code list into that category's folder.Adding a code to the Sealants category would make it possible to apply this code through the Sealants node of the Charting Menu in a patient's Dental chart.Codes that are listed in black have yet to be mapped, while codes in blue are already mapped.Categories and SubcategoriesThe Charting Code Map is organized into main Charting categories which relate directly to the options available in the Charting Menu.

For example, the Crowns category can be divided into subcategories that apply to the level of the procedure such as Full, 3/4, Provisional, Prefab, and Temp. Codes. These subcategories are further divided into the types of material that may be used to perform the procedures. For example, a 3/4 Crown could be performed with Resin, Cast High Noble, Cast Pred. Base, Cast Noble, or Porcelain/Ceramic.Mapping a Fee Schedule's code within Crowns -> 3/4 -> Cast Pred. Base would make this code chartable for this Fee Schedule by selecting Crowns -> 3/4 -> Cast Pred.",454

You'll see a confirmation prompt asking if you're sure.WARNING: In older builds of MacPractice (7.3 and prior), removing the last code in a folder could remove the folder itself, necessitating reverting to the default Charting Code Map.  Deleted codes will remain in the Fee Schedule, but it will no longer be chartable via the Charting Menu of the Dental Tab.Mapping Additional Fee SchedulesWhen charting past procedures in Completed Treatments, procedures and materials that are not typically used may not be present in your current Fee Schedule. In this situation, a separate Fee Schedule can be created with mapped codes for the procedures beyond what the office would generally perform. This Fee Schedule could be used to add the necessary codes. This process will maintain a Fee Schedule that is distinctly applicable to the office's actual procedures, but allow for the accurate charting of past procedures and materials with a second Fee Schedule.For example, an office that does not normally perform Amalgam restorations may not have an Amalgam code in the Fee Schedule. When attempting to chart a two surface Amalgam restoration, the Charting Menu indicates that the option is not available.By using a Fee Schedule created specifically for past procedures rather than codes that are actually performed, the codes can be mapped in the Charting Code Map without adding the codes to your most commonly used Fee Schedule. In the Fee Schedule used on the left of this paragraph, a code has been mapped in the Charting Code Map under Surface Restoration -> Amalgam -> Two Surfaces. When the Fee Schedule is selected in the Charting Menu, the Amalgam can be charted.  Importing and Exporting Charting MapBefore importing a Charting Code Map, make sure you have a fresh backup available!Charting Code Maps can be imported to and exported from MacPractice.",429

MacPractice provides a self-signed certificate that encrypts data between the server and clients, as well as a fingerprint which can be verified through the About MacPractice window. Whenever you first have a client log into a server computer without a signed SSL certificate, you will see the following prompt.Open This message is communicating that the client has noticed that there is no signed SSL certificate from a certificate issuer on the Server computer. As MacPractice provides a self-signed certificate, communication to the MacPractice Server are still protected, but this message will appear as a precaution. To take all necessary security steps, you will want to verify that SHA-256 fingerprint in this message matches your server computer.Note For Older Builds: On older builds of MacPractice, you may see a ""SHA1"" fingerprint, the steps to verify are the same.To verify you are directly connecting to your server, the fingerprint within the Identify Verification window of the client machine can be compared to the fingerprint within the About MacPractice window on the server computer.From the MacPractice Server, access the About MacPractice window by selecting MacPractice from the menu bar.Open Next, select the About MacPractice item. In the resulting About MacPractice window, verify the Certificate SHA-256 fingerprint on the server exactly matches the Certificate SHA-256 fingerprint from the client.If the fingerprints match, you may safely click the ""Trust and Continue"" button on the client Identity Verification window. Once trusted, the Identity Verification window will no longer appear on the client machine. When the MacPractice Server identity cannot be verified, we highly advise that you consult with a Networking Specialist to resolve any networking issues and potential security risks.",455

Unlike Categories and Parts, which are holding areas for information, Templates are the actual predesigned Note. Some example templates are available in the Shared Templates library. Many offices will create templates for documents such as new patient welcome letters, collection letters, referral letters, consent forms, pre-procedure instruction sheets, and more.1 Creating a Template2 Editing a Template3 Creating a Custom Form Using Notes4 Shared Note Templates5 Downloading Templates6 Uploading Templates7 Exporting Templates8 Note Template Groups9 Creating a Note Template Group10 Using Note Template GroupsCreating a TemplateTo create a template, select the Templates node in the sidebar of the Notes ability and click the green plus button in the upper left corner of the MacPractice window. The new template's initial contents (pull fields or text) and margins are set in the Default Template record.Open Open Template with examples of pull fields in the <<>> bracketsWithin the body of the new template, text can be entered and pull fields can be dragged from the pull field palette. Since templates are not associated with a specific patient, when a pull field is added it will be displayed as a placeholder. In the image to the right, you can see an example of a template that includes a number of pull fields for office and patient demographic information, as well as the provider's title, name, and suffix. This template is based on the New Patient Welcome letter that is available in the Shared Template library.       You can use the Merge Fields button in the lower left hand corner of MacPractice to access the Pull Field palette, which contains several Pull Fields that you can drag and drop into a Template. Pull fields ""pull"" in information from the patient's account into the template to provide patient-specific information.For information on adding headers, changing the font, or other formatting questions, please click here.",478

This is to prevent inadvertent changes to the template. To edit a template, simply select it from the Template node and uncheck the Locked checkbox. Then you can modify the template content as necessary.Creating a Custom Form Using NotesCreate a note template as outlined above. Within the template, blanks can be added to create easily navigable fields in the form. To add a placeholder line, place the cursor where you wish to add a custom word or phrase, and press the Shift and underscore ( _ ) keys to create the line (keep pressing the underscore key until you have achieved the desired length). Displayed below is a Registration Documents template (available in the Shared Templates library) with blanks where an office can enter the specific fees charged for each service. This is just an example - custom templates can be created for a multitude of functions and purposes.Create a patient note from the template. The underscore lines can be navigated to by using the Shift + Tab keyboard shortcut to move directly to the next placeholder, allowing a user to enter information and customize the note for your selected patient. Repeat until the form is filled out. In the example below, the same template as above is visible, but two of the blanks have been filled out. The third blank is highlighted and ready for data entry.When done entering information, save the changes by selecting the Edit menu and choosing Save Record, or using the Command-S keyboard shortcut.Shared Note TemplatesThe Shared Templates node of the Notes ability contains a library of templates created by other MacPractice users that can be downloaded and added to an office's database.Downloading TemplatesTo download a template in the Notes Ability, select the Shared Templates node in the sidebar.

They can be very useful for maintenance tasks or when you need to make changes to many accounts to improve your office's workflow.This article will cover some of the most common database utilities used by our offices, and how to utilize them properly.If you are looking for a more complete list of all Database Utilities, please click here.Warning: Before running any Database Utility, you should always ensure the following:You should always make sure you have a current backup. A Backup is NECESSARY before performing database utilities.You should make sure that no one is currently logged into MacPractice.1 Move Patient to Another Account2 Moving A Patient To Their Own Account3 Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing Account3.1 Things to Know4 Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$5 Remove Insurance Portion6 Revert Write-Off To Open Balance7 Update Account Provider8 Update Account Statement Status9 Update Fee Schedule10 Update Patient Fee Schedule11 Update Patient Insurance12 Update Patient Provider13 Update Procedure Type By CodeMove Patient to Another AccountThe ""Move Patient To Another Account"" Utility is used to move a Patient from one Account to either another pre-existing Account, or to move a Patient to a brand new Account. This Utility is great for situations like when a child on one Account has come of age and wants to be on their own Account so the parents aren't paying their medical bills anymore, or in cases where a family splits up but continues to see the practice separately.This Utility cannot be used to merge duplicate patient records together.",428
277,"Unfortunately in those situations you'll need to re-enter the missing information into the appropriate Account, and then archive or delete the invalid Account.Note: Before using the ""Move Patient to Another Account"" Database Utility, a patient needs to have...The Relationship to Primary set to anything BUT ""Self"" in the Patients Ability > Patient Tab.You only can move a patient if they are not the Primary Guarantor of the account.All unapplied balances connected to the account the patient is being moved from should be addressed before running this Utility. Moving A Patient To Their Own AccountGo to the Managers ability and select Database Utilities in the sidebar. In the Database Utilities menu, select select Move Patient To Another Account. You'll be presented with the following fields: Open  The first row is the Account and Patient number, Last Name, and First Name of the Patient who is moving.We strongly advise clicking the Magnifying Glass icon to search for and select the specific Patient. The second row is the Destination Account number, Destination Last Name, and Destination First Name. In this scenario, you'll leave the 2nd row blank as shown in the image, as this indicates that you wish to move the Patient to a new Account. Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window. You'll be reminded to ensure all users are logged out of MacPractice at this time. Click ""OK"" when you have confirmed this is true. Open  You'll then be taken to a prompt to automatically save a Backup. If you have already confirmed you have a fresh backup available as indicated in the beginning in the article, you can cancel this prompt. Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's new account will display with the new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing AccountMoving a Patient To Another Account works exactly the same way as Moving a Patient to their Own Account. The only difference is instead of leaving the 2nd row blank, you'll select a Destination Account instead, as shown in the below screenshot.  Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window.",501

However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule. There are actually two utilities that perform this function.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a percentage amount. For example, you can choose to lower all fees by 4.5%. This utility also contains options to control how the utility handles rounding.",466
279,"The image above reflects this utility.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by $: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a given dollar amount. For example, you can choose to raise all fees by a flat $50 rate.As an precaution, you may want to make a duplicate of the fee schedule you intend to run this utility for. You can do this by navigating to the References Ability, selecting the Fee Schedule node, then selecting the Fee Schedule in question. From the Menu, select Edit > Duplicate Fee Schedule.For either Utility, you'll first set whether you want to Raise or Lower, then select the Fee Schedule you wish to adjust.If you're using the percentage utility, you'll need to indicate the percentage amount you want to raise or lower by in the Raise By/Lower By field. Then, select the rounding option. You can choose to round to the nearest dollar amount, whether to round UP to the nearest dollar amount, or not to round at all.For example, if a $100 dollar fee was increased by 4.1%, you'd be left with 104.10.Do Not Round would leave this amount as is.Round to the nearest dollar would round this value DOWN to 104.00.Round up to the nearest dollar would round this value UP to 105.00.If you're using the dollar amount utility, all you need to do is indicate the dollar amount which you want to raise or lower your fees in the Fee Schedule by.Remove Insurance PortionThe Remove Insurance Portion Database Utility allows the user to remove unexpected insurance portions from patients' ledgers. You can choose to run this for a specific account, or for all patients within your database.First, you'll select whether you want to impact all patients in the database, or a specific account. If you select ""For Account"", a field will appear allowing you to enter an account number.Next, you'll set whether you want the utility to hide charges with accurate portions, or charges that aren't on outstanding claims. These are checkboxes; you can either have one, both, or none checked.By clicking ""Show Charges with Insurance Portions"", the Charge Table will populate with all charges with insurance portions.

This is often used to standardize how statements are sent for your patients.First, you'll select the Statement Status which you wish to transition patient accounts FROM using the ""Current Statement Status"" field.Then you'll select the Statement Status you want to transition patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Status"" field.Finally, you can choose whether you also wish to update the ""Send Statement To"" field for all impacted patient accounts.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Fee ScheduleThe Update Fee Schedule Database Utility is used to update several characteristics of the codes within a Fee Schedule. The Utility will update either all of your Fee Schedules or a specific Fee Schedule, and you can also hone down and change characteristics for a defined range of charge codes.First, you'll define which Fee Schedule you wish to update in the ""Update Fees in Fee Schedule"" pop-up menu. If you want to update all of your Fee Schedules, you can select the ""All Fee Schedules"" option.",456
281,"Then, if there is a specific range of codes you would like to update, set that range in the ""Code Start"" and ""Code End"" fields.Next, you'll use the checkboxes on the left side to choose which characteristics to update, and then use the corresponding pop up menus to choose what to update that characteristic TO. For example, if I wanted to update all fee schedule codes to have Dr. Awesome set as the default provider, I'd check the Default Provider checkbox, then select ""Bob Awesome"" in the Default Provider pop-up.With this utility, you can update:Default ProviderDefault OfficePlace of ServiceType of ServiceDefault RecallProcedure TypeProcedure CategorySet ""Require Co-Pay""Set ""Require Lab""When satisfied, click the Go button to run the Database Utility.Update Patient Fee ScheduleThis particular utility is used to update the Default Fee Schedule, selected in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability, for all patients with a given Fee Schedule selected.First, you need to select what Fee Schedule you want to change FROM by selecting the Fee Schedule in the ""Update All Patients with Fee Schedule"" field.Then, you need to select the Fee Schedule you want to switch these patients TO in the ""To Fee Schedule"" field.Once you're satisfied, click the Go button to run this utility.

If there's a specific plan that you want to transition patients from, you can define that in the corresponding ""Plan Name"" field.Then, you can select the carrier which you want to change patients TO in the ""Update to Carrier"" field, along with any specific plan to transition patients to if desired.Finally, if you want to define the start/end dates for each patient, you can do so by checking the ""Update New Insurance's Start Date and Old Insurance's End Date As"" checkbox and then using the date field to define a specific date. This will serve as the new insurance's Start Date and the old insurance's End Date.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the utility.Update Patient ProviderThis Utility is used to update the default Provider for all patients from one provider to another provider.

However, at some point there may be a need to view reports directly, apart from what is viewable while in the eClaims Node.The following elements within the Reports Node are used to interact directly with the eClaim reports. Their descriptions are described below:Reports Node - ExpandedIf unarchived eClaim reports are present in MacPractice, a triangle will be visible next to the Reports Node, in the sidebar. Clicking on this triangle will expand the contents of the Reports Node, making them viewable to the user.Open If the user clicks on the individual report within the node, the contents of that report will be viewable for the user.Note that it is difficult to determine which report belongs to which claims, as there will be nothing in the file names of reports to indicate this. If the user wants to view claim reports for a specific patient, from within the Reports Node, the user can type the patient's name in the search bar. This will bring all reports that contain information for that patient's claims. Keep in mind that most reports contain status information of multiple claims, for multiple patients.",446
285,"Even when the report comes up that contains the desired patient's information, the user will most likely need to scroll through the report to find that specific patient's claim status information.Receive ButtonThe Receive Button is used to manually receive reports. When there are no claims that can be sent, but there are claims in Sent that are awaiting reports, the user can select the Reports Node in the sidebar and click the Receive Button. This will force MacPractice to send a request to the partner clearinghouse, Change Healthcare, to download any outstanding reports. This will also receive any ERAsthat are awaiting download from the office.After the user clicks the Receive Button, while MacPractice is retrieving reports from the clearinghouse, MacPractice will be unusable for a short time. During this time, the bottom frame of the eClaims window will state ""Receiving report data. Please wait..."". Once MacPractice has downloaded all available reports, a Transfer Results Window will appear.The Transfer Results Window will list the names of all reports and all ERAs that have been received during this Receive Reports session. It will also note how many claims have been moved to the Accepted Bin and how many have been moved to the Rejected Bin. If a multiple reports come in for a single claim, every time a different report affects that claim, it will be counted in the number of claims affected.For example: if a claim was accepted by the clearinghouse and rejected by the payer, but nobody has received reports in a while, the clearinghouse rejection will first apply to the claim, then the payer rejection will apply to the claim. The Transfer Results Window will note that 1 claim has been moved to accepted and 1 claim has been moved to rejected. It appears in the window that two claims have been moved, but in fact it was the same claim, which has been affected twice in the same Receive Reports session. The same can happen if multiple Accepted or Rejected responses come in for the same claim.If the user clicks OK, the window will disappear.If ERAs have come in during the Receive Reports session, the Print ERAs Button will be usable at this time. If no ERAs were received, the Print ERAs Button will be grayed out.",496
286,"Clicking this button will bring down a print window.The Print Window will offer several options to the user. Select the options in this window that will work best for the office's needs.Archive ButtoneClaim reports cannot be deleted from MacPractice. They can only be archived. The Archive Button allows the user to archive older reports. Archiving does not untie the reports from their associated claims. It only removes the reports from the Reports Node.The user can twist down the Reports Node and select each report individually and press the Archive Button. There will be no prompt or warning when reports are archived this way. The report will simply disappear from the Reports Node. Only one report at a time can be archived by this method.If the user highlights the Reports Node itself and presses the Archive Button, a sheet will drop down. In this sheet, the user needs only to simply check the box next to the items they wish to archive. Clicking ""Check all rows"" will place a checkmark next to every item in the sheet. Once all desired items are checked, the user can then press the Archive Button. This will archive all records that were selected in the sheet. Unarchive ButtonReports that have been archived can be retrieved, by using the Unarchive Button. To unarchive reports, simply press the Unarchive Button.After the Unarchive Button is pressed, a sheet will drop down, containing a list of all archived reports. From here, the user can check the box next to the reports they wish to retrieve, or they can opt to select all of the items in the sheet by clicking the ""check all rows"" box at the bottom of the sheet. Once all desired reports are checked, the user need only press the Retrieve Button at the bottom of the sheet. This will return all selected reports to the Reports Node in the eClaims Ability.'Template To Receive From' Pop-up MenuSome offices have more than one ProxyMed template. This is the template that is used for Change Healthcare claims. The template can be renamed, often renamed for specific doctors, to keep their claim submissions separated.If a user wishes to only download reports that tie to a specific eClaims template, the user can click on the 'Template To Receive From' menu and select just that template.",495

It is recommended that users manually move claims to the appropriate bin, based on whichever method claim statuses are communicated by the non-partner clearinghouse.When a claim is sent through MacPractice's partner clearinghouse, and the claim has been rejected, either by the clearinghouse or the payer, the rejection message will appear in the eClaim Status Panel in red text.Occasionally a claim may reject at the clearinghouse or payer, and then later may be reprocessed. It is possible at that time for this same claim to be accepted. A report will come back from the payer or the clearinghouse that indicates the claim has now been accepted. However, no claims will ever automatically move from Rejected to Accepted. If a claim is ever rejected, then later accepted, it will need to be manually moved by the user to the Accepted Bin. {""serverDuration"": 16, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""68ec74690b2842648d50da0203f4e3e5""}",359

302,"Unfortunately in those situations you'll need to re-enter the missing information into the appropriate Account, and then archive or delete the invalid Account.Note: Before using the ""Move Patient to Another Account"" Database Utility, a patient needs to have...The Relationship to Primary set to anything BUT ""Self"" in the Patients Ability > Patient Tab.You only can move a patient if they are not the Primary Guarantor of the account.All unapplied balances connected to the account the patient is being moved from should be addressed before running this Utility. Moving A Patient To Their Own AccountGo to the Managers ability and select Database Utilities in the sidebar.

However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule.

To make changes, please call our Support Line and ask to make changes to your Office Reference.Open Multiple Office ReferencesMultiple Office References function under the same MacPractice network and use the same MacPractice serial and licenses. Most practices need only a single office reference. However, you may need an additional office reference if:You wish to track reporting separately for two entities within your practice (and it cannot be done solely on provider information), such as keeping two separate sets of Accounts Receivable information.You need a different billing address on your claim form (Box 33 on the CMS-1500 form, box 48 on the ADA form).If you have more than one TAX ID. For example, if your office has multiple offices, practices, or providers.NOTE: Once you have a second office reference, it cannot be removed or transferred to another database.If you are interested in purchasing a second office reference, please contact MacPractice Support for assistance. We can be reached by phone at 877-220-8418 or by email at support@macpractice.com.Mailing Address vs Physical LocationOpen In the Office reference, you have two tabs: Mailing Address and Physical Location. The address stored in the Mailing Address tab is part of your license information and cannot be edited. The Physical Location tab is used with eClaims, and should only be used under the direction of the MacPractice EDI Department. Mailing Address is the address that the office chooses to use for their postal address. This can and is often the physical address of the office as well. The physical location should ONLY be used if the mailing address for the office is a P.O. Box. eClaims are required to show where services were rendered, and this is not possible from a P.O. Box. If the mailing address and the physical location are the SAME, then use of the physical location tab is not needed.",497

You will want to be familiar with the terms listed below. Please review the Glossary for a full list of terminology.Change Healthcare (n., EDI) A medical claims clearinghouse supported by MacPractice. Change Healthcare may also be known by its former names, Capario, MedAvant or ProxyMed.Change Healthcare has recently rebranded to Optum, but the vast majority of our clients still refer to Change Healthcare.clearinghouse (n., EDI) A central institution or agency for the collection, maintenance, and distribution of electronic data. Clearinghouses will transmit and convert electronic data for a payer. Some clearinghouses will even process claims.DentalXChange (n., EDI) A dental insurance claims clearinghouse supported by MacPractice. DentalXChange may also be referred to as EHG, their company name, or ClaimConnect, the name of their website.eClaim (n., EDI) An insurance claim that is sent electronically.EDI (n.) Abbreviation for Electronic Data Interchange. The exchange of standardized document forms between computer systems for business use. The EDI department at MacPractice handles all electronic claims, electronic remittance advice and electronic statements, as well as real-time transaction support through our clearinghouses' portal services.EFT (n.) Abbreviation for electronic funds transfer. If the provider has an EFT agreement with a payer, the payer will deposit funds into the provider's bank account via an automated (banking) clearinghouse (ACH). In MacPractice, users can flag insurance payments as EFTs, and will then have the option to exclude EFT from the deposit slip.ERA (n., EDI) Abbreviation for electronic remittance advice.",457
324,"Sometimes known as an ERN or Electronic Remittance Notice, an ERA is an electronic version of a remittance, also known as an EOB or Explanation of Benefits.legacy (adj., claims) Used to refer to non-NPI identifiers that may still be sent on claims. Sometimes also called PIN numbers or PTANs.NPI (n., claims) Abbreviation for National Provider Identification. The NPI is a 10-digit unique identification number for covered health care providers. Covered health care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses will use the NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA. After May 23, 2008 the NPI must be used in lieu of legacy provider identifiers in all HIPAA-standard transactions.payer (n., claims) An entity who pays a provider for services rendered to a patient. This includes but is not limited to insurance carriers. Not all payers are insurance carriers, not all insurance carriers are payers.payer ID (n., EDI) An identification number for a payer that is required for electronic claims submission. Payer IDs are specific to each clearinghouse for each payer.portal (n.) A website run by a clearinghouse or payer which allows access to certain aspects of their data systems. Portals allow providers to perform real-time transactions such as eligibility checks, claims status inquiries, and real-time claims submission as well as viewing claim data.provider (n.) An entity who renders services to a patient. This includes but is not limited to doctors.PTAN (n., claims) Abbreviation for Provider Transaction Access Number. Also known as a provider PIN number or a Legacy number. Providers typically do not send these numbers on claims after the May 23rd, 2008 NPI only date but they might still need these numbers for Medicare enrollment and Medicare eligibility checks.submitter (n., EDI) Any entity who submits claims directly to a payer or trading partner.trading partner (n., EDI) A secondary clearinghouse that acts as an intermediary between one clearinghouse and the payer.Invalid v. Rejected v. Denied claimsThe difference between invalid, rejected, and denied claims Claims sent electronically can be either rejected, denied or invalid. Invalid claims are stopped by MacPractice because of missing or incomplete claim information.",491
325,"MacPractice cannot filter for all billing criteria, but the software can catch some major issues before they get sent, enabling you to resolve issues quickly.Rejected claims are stopped either by a clearinghouse, trading partner or payer's front end computer. Since rejected claims are stopped by a computer, the response is sent back electronically with your eClaims reports. Rejection messages allow you to receive information back on your eClaims much faster than you would with a paper claim. Because of their nature, rejection messages can be difficult to decipher. The MacPractice Support Department will assist with electronic claim rejections if using one of our dedicated clearinghouses.Denied claims have passed every computer edit but were denied by the Payer's claims processing floor. Denials will come back to a provider via an EOB or ERA. Claims are typically denied for billing issues, which MacPractice cannot advise on. The payer should be the first line of contact for denials, as they are the source of the denial.The difference between credentialing and enrollingBeing credentialed refers to having Provider information on file with a Payer for the purpose of sending claims. The office is responsible for all Payer credentials. MacPractice cannot offer any assistance or advice with the credentialing process, however Medicare requires an 855 form to be completed to gain acceptance into the Medicare program. Visit CMS for more information on the credentialing process. Many payers use the terms credentialed and enrolled interchangeably, therefore MacPractice uses the term enrollment to refer exclusive to EDI enrollment.Several payers require an additional enrollment to send electronic claims. This might be known as an EDI enrollment, EDI agreement, Submitter agreement, and so forth. The MacPractice Enrollment Department will assist with the eClaims enrollment process if using one of our dedicated clearinghouses. To make sure the enrollment process goes smoothly, please make sure to provide all requested information and make sure that all credentials are up to date with all Payers.The difference between Accepts Assignment and ParticipateAccepts Assignment means that the provider accepts the carrier's allowed amounts. Definitions of Accepts Assignment vary by payer, the provider should contact the payer for clarification. Generally it means that the provider will receive the payment for the visit. For Medicare, Accepts Assignment means that the provider agrees to Medicare's allowed amount for the procedure and cannot charge the patient more than the contracted allowed amount.",485

A Backup is NECESSARY before performing database utilities.You should make sure that no one is currently logged into MacPractice.1 Move Patient to Another Account2 Moving A Patient To Their Own Account3 Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing Account3.1 Things to Know4 Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$5 Remove Insurance Portion6 Revert Write-Off To Open Balance7 Update Account Provider8 Update Account Statement Status9 Update Fee Schedule10 Update Patient Fee Schedule11 Update Patient Insurance12 Update Patient Provider13 Update Procedure Type By CodeMove Patient to Another AccountThe ""Move Patient To Another Account"" Utility is used to move a Patient from one Account to either another pre-existing Account, or to move a Patient to a brand new Account. This Utility is great for situations like when a child on one Account has come of age and wants to be on their own Account so the parents aren't paying their medical bills anymore, or in cases where a family splits up but continues to see the practice separately.This Utility cannot be used to merge duplicate patient records together.",416
334,"Unfortunately in those situations you'll need to re-enter the missing information into the appropriate Account, and then archive or delete the invalid Account.Note: Before using the ""Move Patient to Another Account"" Database Utility, a patient needs to have...The Relationship to Primary set to anything BUT ""Self"" in the Patients Ability > Patient Tab.You only can move a patient if they are not the Primary Guarantor of the account.All unapplied balances connected to the account the patient is being moved from should be addressed before running this Utility. Moving A Patient To Their Own AccountGo to the Managers ability and select Database Utilities in the sidebar. In the Database Utilities menu, select select Move Patient To Another Account. You'll be presented with the following fields: Open  The first row is the Account and Patient number, Last Name, and First Name of the Patient who is moving.We strongly advise clicking the Magnifying Glass icon to search for and select the specific Patient. The second row is the Destination Account number, Destination Last Name, and Destination First Name. In this scenario, you'll leave the 2nd row blank as shown in the image, as this indicates that you wish to move the Patient to a new Account. Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window. You'll be reminded to ensure all users are logged out of MacPractice at this time. Click ""OK"" when you have confirmed this is true. Open  You'll then be taken to a prompt to automatically save a Backup. If you have already confirmed you have a fresh backup available as indicated in the beginning in the article, you can cancel this prompt. Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's new account will display with the new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing AccountMoving a Patient To Another Account works exactly the same way as Moving a Patient to their Own Account. The only difference is instead of leaving the 2nd row blank, you'll select a Destination Account instead, as shown in the below screenshot.  Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window.",501

Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's destination account will display with their new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Things to KnowYou may move patients who have financial histories and even remaining balances to their own or to other accounts. However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule. There are actually two utilities that perform this function.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a percentage amount. For example, you can choose to lower all fees by 4.5%. This utility also contains options to control how the utility handles rounding.",466
336,"The image above reflects this utility.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by $: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a given dollar amount. For example, you can choose to raise all fees by a flat $50 rate.As an precaution, you may want to make a duplicate of the fee schedule you intend to run this utility for. You can do this by navigating to the References Ability, selecting the Fee Schedule node, then selecting the Fee Schedule in question. From the Menu, select Edit > Duplicate Fee Schedule.For either Utility, you'll first set whether you want to Raise or Lower, then select the Fee Schedule you wish to adjust.If you're using the percentage utility, you'll need to indicate the percentage amount you want to raise or lower by in the Raise By/Lower By field. Then, select the rounding option. You can choose to round to the nearest dollar amount, whether to round UP to the nearest dollar amount, or not to round at all.For example, if a $100 dollar fee was increased by 4.1%, you'd be left with 104.10.Do Not Round would leave this amount as is.Round to the nearest dollar would round this value DOWN to 104.00.Round up to the nearest dollar would round this value UP to 105.00.If you're using the dollar amount utility, all you need to do is indicate the dollar amount which you want to raise or lower your fees in the Fee Schedule by.Remove Insurance PortionThe Remove Insurance Portion Database Utility allows the user to remove unexpected insurance portions from patients' ledgers. You can choose to run this for a specific account, or for all patients within your database.First, you'll select whether you want to impact all patients in the database, or a specific account. If you select ""For Account"", a field will appear allowing you to enter an account number.Next, you'll set whether you want the utility to hide charges with accurate portions, or charges that aren't on outstanding claims. These are checkboxes; you can either have one, both, or none checked.By clicking ""Show Charges with Insurance Portions"", the Charge Table will populate with all charges with insurance portions. By scrolling right, you can see the status of the Primary and Secondary Insurance, if applicable. You'll also be able to see the Insurance Portion currently on the shown charges.From here, you can simply check and uncheck charges you wish to remove the insurance portion of.",499
337,"Once you're satisfied, clicking Go will run the database utility for those checked charges. Revert Write-Off To Open BalanceThis database utility relates directly to write-off changes made in MacPractice 10.7. Please click here for a detailed article on those write-off changes and how to use the Revert Write-Off To Open Balance utility.Update Account ProviderThe Update Account Provider Database Utility is used to adjust the Account Provider (located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability) from one Provider to another Provider for all patient accounts in the database.First, you'll select the Provider you want to change all your patient accounts FROM in the ""Current Provider"" field.Then, you'll select the Provider you want to change all of your patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Provider"" field.Finally, if you want to adjust the Account Office for all patient accounts, you'll want to check the ""Also Update Office"" checkbox and use the ""Update Office To"" pop up to select the desired office.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Account Statement StatusThis utility updates the ""Where To Send Statements"" and the ""Monthly Statement Options"" fields, located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability, for all patients in your database. This is often used to standardize how statements are sent for your patients.First, you'll select the Statement Status which you wish to transition patient accounts FROM using the ""Current Statement Status"" field.Then you'll select the Statement Status you want to transition patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Status"" field.Finally, you can choose whether you also wish to update the ""Send Statement To"" field for all impacted patient accounts.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Fee ScheduleThe Update Fee Schedule Database Utility is used to update several characteristics of the codes within a Fee Schedule. The Utility will update either all of your Fee Schedules or a specific Fee Schedule, and you can also hone down and change characteristics for a defined range of charge codes.First, you'll define which Fee Schedule you wish to update in the ""Update Fees in Fee Schedule"" pop-up menu. If you want to update all of your Fee Schedules, you can select the ""All Fee Schedules"" option.",456
338,"Then, if there is a specific range of codes you would like to update, set that range in the ""Code Start"" and ""Code End"" fields.Next, you'll use the checkboxes on the left side to choose which characteristics to update, and then use the corresponding pop up menus to choose what to update that characteristic TO. For example, if I wanted to update all fee schedule codes to have Dr. Awesome set as the default provider, I'd check the Default Provider checkbox, then select ""Bob Awesome"" in the Default Provider pop-up.With this utility, you can update:Default ProviderDefault OfficePlace of ServiceType of ServiceDefault RecallProcedure TypeProcedure CategorySet ""Require Co-Pay""Set ""Require Lab""When satisfied, click the Go button to run the Database Utility.Update Patient Fee ScheduleThis particular utility is used to update the Default Fee Schedule, selected in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability, for all patients with a given Fee Schedule selected.First, you need to select what Fee Schedule you want to change FROM by selecting the Fee Schedule in the ""Update All Patients with Fee Schedule"" field.Then, you need to select the Fee Schedule you want to switch these patients TO in the ""To Fee Schedule"" field.Once you're satisfied, click the Go button to run this utility. All patients with the first selected Fee Schedule will then have the second Fee Schedule selected.Update Patient InsuranceThis database utility is used to adjust patients with one insurance carrier and plan to a different insurance carrier and plan.First, you'll select the carrier which you want to change patients FROM in the ""Current Carrier"" field. If there's a specific plan that you want to transition patients from, you can define that in the corresponding ""Plan Name"" field.Then, you can select the carrier which you want to change patients TO in the ""Update to Carrier"" field, along with any specific plan to transition patients to if desired.Finally, if you want to define the start/end dates for each patient, you can do so by checking the ""Update New Insurance's Start Date and Old Insurance's End Date As"" checkbox and then using the date field to define a specific date. This will serve as the new insurance's Start Date and the old insurance's End Date.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the utility.Update Patient ProviderThis Utility is used to update the default Provider for all patients from one provider to another provider. This Provider field is located in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability.",496

Above the incident list is the Incident Menu, which can be used to create, archive, retrieve or delete incidents.Open Treatment PlansThe Treatment Plans node in the Ledger sidebar is generally used as a quick view of all existing Treatment Plans.The Treatment Plan Status can also be adjusted here. If the cursor is moved next to the status, an x will appear. Clicking the x will hide the treatment plan from this view but will not remove it.Account LedgerThe Account Ledger is a list of all Ledger activity in a single account. You can expand the Account Ledger and select the individual Patient to view all of their transactions on one place. You cannot post, open or delete a payment/charge in this area. If you attempt to preform one of these actions while in the Account Ledger, you will be taken to the incident associated with the item, and the transaction will be highlighted.The Account Ledger is also the only place where you will be able to see Finance Charges on the account, because a finance charge is applied to the account as a whole, not a specific incident. Typically, the finance charges are based upon the Provider/Office selected in the patient's Account tab; however, these may be overridden by double clicking and editing directly on the patient's Account Ledger. IncidentThe Incident allows users to separate a patient's transactions by date, type of procedure, reason for visit, or any number of criteria.When selected, the Incident will display the Incident Tabs  on the right side of the screen. These tabs are used to add more details regarding the selected incident as well as adding additional information on claims. Once you expand the incident you can select the Contract Billing (if any), Transactions and Treatment Plan for that incident.

Additional enrollment and/or testing may be required for these payers.Insurance ReferenceWhen setting up worker's comp payers, besides paying attention to the differing payer IDs, you will also want to make sure the plan type is set to 'Worker's Compensation'. This will ensure the claim is sent as a W.C. Professional claim, and not a generic Professional claim. Having this set incorrectly can cause the claim to reject.Patient AbilityWhen filling out information on patient and primary tabs, this information can vary based on the payer. MOST companies would like to see the Employer listed on the claim with the patient being listed as the Employee. To be sure of how this needs to reflect on the claim, the office should contact the payer for submission requirements.On the Primary/Secondary Tab, enter the employer with the employer's Worker's Compensation Insurance. There is an 'Employers' section in the middle third of the Primary/Secondary Tab of the Patients Ability.On the Patient Tab, be sure the patient listed is the employee for the aforementioned employer.

We strongly recommend adjusting Global Preferences from the Server computer, as this will ensure those Preferences then carry over.Other MacPractice Configuration OptionsThere are MacPractice Configuration Options that are not included in the Preferences window.

The interface will allow your providers to add new patients, review clinical history, and send an electronic care slip to the Orders Ability within MacPractice. This article reviews the general usage of the iPhone/iPad Interface. Each interface behaves essentially the same, but is tailored to the format of the iPhone or the iPad.  The iPhone and iPad Interfaces only function when your MacPractice Server uses MacOS Catalina or older, so effectively Build 13 and below of MacPractice. We have also released MacPractice Go, our more modern web-based solution to a method to accessing MacPractice data remotely. MP Go is included for free on your license. Click here to learn more about MP Go!1 Overview of the Interface1.1 Adjusting your Preferences2 Schedule Ability3 Patients Ability4 Rx Ability5 Reports6 ReferrersIn this guide, we presume you already have the interface installed and configured. You can download and install the iPhone or iPad interface from the MacPractice Downloads page. For instructions on enabling SSL and PHP, click here. These instructions are complicated and if upon review you feel uncomfortable following these directions, don't hesitate to contact MacPractice Support. We're more than happy to assist you with this process.Overview of the InterfaceWhen you first access your interface page in your browser, you'll be treated to a login screen.Open This log in screen asks for your MacPractice username and password.Once you've logged in, you'll be presented with the Schedule Ability for today's date.The Interface shares a lot of elements with MacPractice. You can see your available abilities at the top of the window. What we first recommend is to visit the Preferences Ability in order to configure the information available to you on the Interface.Adjusting your PreferencesBy clicking the Preferences Ability, you're taken to the screen on the right, where you can adjust a limited number of options.",497
367,"You should review these and adjust them to meet your needs before progressing further. The available Preferences are, from top to bottom:   Log Out: This pop-out menu controls how long a user can be idle until they are automatically logged out of the Interface. The options range from 5/10/15/20/25/30 minutes, or Never. We recommend 5 minutes or higher to protect your office's data.Appointment Time Order: This option controls whether Appointments in the Schedule Ability of the Interface are sorted from First to Last, or from Last to First.Show Today's Past Appointments: If enabled, this option will display all appointments for today. If disabled, you'll instead only be shown the remaining appointments that haven't occurred yet for today.Show Appointments of All Providers: If enabled, this option will display all appointments whether they are assigned to your current provider user or not. If disabled, you'll only be able to see the appointments assigned to your currently logged in provider user.Show My Resources Only: If enabled, this option will only show you appointments that are scheduled on a Resource tied to your provider user. If disabled, you will be able to appointments scheduled to any resource. Diagnosis Codes: This option, when enabled, allows you to add diagnosis codes to posted charges in the Patients Ability of the Interface.Modifiers: This option, when enabled, allows you to add modifiers to posted charges in the Patients Ability of the Interface.This screen also lists the type and version of Interface you're currently using. Schedule AbilityThe Schedule Ability on the Interface allows you to review the office schedule. While you cannot make any additional appointments, you're able to access your entire appointment history.If you touch on an appointment, you'll be brought to their Appointment Info in the Patients Ability on the Interface.By default, you are only able to see appointments for your user's schedule resource without tinkering in Preferences (covered earlier in the article).You can view the Schedule in List format, as shown in the above screenshot, or you can switch to the Calendar view, which resembles how the schedule appears in MacPractice ordinarily.",434
368,"Both options are available right underneath the toolbar in the upper left.If you don't want to include a particular resource included in the results, you can uncheck the resource in the left pane by touching the checkbox.Patients AbilityThe Patients Ability in the Interface allows you to review information in a patient's account.There are many similarities to the Patient Ability within MacPractice, although some information is still unavailable on the Interface.In the upper left hand corner of the view, you can see a green plus icon that you can use to add a patient to the database. There's also a ""View All Patients"" button to pull up all patient records to peruse. This can take a long time to load, so we recommend using the Patient Search bar to pinpoint a specific patient without the wait.The Alerts indicator allows you to see what alerts are on the patient account.The tabs are, in order:Clinical: This tab contains information that has been added to the patient's Clinical record in the Clinical Tab in MacPractice. You're able to add Vital records from here.Patient: This tab contains the patient's demographic information as stored in the Patients Ability in the Patient Tab. Appt Info: This tab will be present if there is a linked appointment you tapped on in the Schedule. Follow-Ups: This tab tracks any follow-up/recalls listed on the patient's account.Referrals: This tab lists any referrals made on the patient's account in the Patient tab of the Patients Ability.Custom: This tab contains any information added into the Custom section of the Patient tab of the Patients Ability.Appts: This tab lists all appointmentsNotes: This tab pulls in information from the Notes section in the Patient tab of the Patients Ability in MacPractice.

The drawer is used for such things as reference-specific reports, editing transparency blocks, repeating appointments, and other miscellaneous functions. As a result, the drawer will be going away when the latest macOS (Mojave) is released to the public.We've been working hard at a solution that will retain the exact same functionality as the drawer contained, but without the drawer. In prior builds, we've already added the List Window, located in the Window Menu. This allows you to access the lists created from reports and use those lists to generate postcards and other forms. In MacPractice Gen 11, we'll be releasing the other solutions to replace the functionality of the drawer.This article will discuss the areas of MacPractice that have been changed in 11.1, and how to use the replaced features.1 Introducing the Inspector2 Changes to Reference Reports3 Changes to Scheduling Repeating Appointments 4 Changes to Transparencies4.1 Transparency WorkflowIntroducing the InspectorThe drawer icon, typically located in the lower left corner of the MacPractice window, has been replaced with an ""I"" icon for the Inspector. The Inspector behaves very similarly to the Drawer. It will display context-appropriate options depending on where you are in MacPractice.Open Eventually, the button in the lower left will be removed to add some breathing room, but we will leave it in for the next few builds so as to not completely pull the rug out from underneath our offices! We encourage you to become accustomed to accessing the Inspector from the lower right button.You can also access the Inspector from the View Menu. This will open or close the Inspector. You can also press Command-I on the keyboard to open and close the Inspector.Open Regardless of the method used, the Inspector view will pop out from the right, and can be resized.Changes to Reference ReportsReference Reports have mostly stayed the same thanks to the new Inspector.",483
370,"Whenever you would want to review any report information that was normally in the Drawer, you can simply open up the Inspector to get the same contextual information you used to!Changes to Scheduling Repeating Appointments Prior to MacPractice 11, scheduling repeating appointments required the use of the drawer. We've moved that functionality into the Schedule Ability.To schedule a repeating appointment, you'll first schedule an appointment for a patient as normal. Once you have that down on the schedule, right-click the appointment block and select ""Repeat"".The new repeating appointments sheet is very similar to the Appointments tab in the Drawer. At the top of the sheet, you can see all of the appointment details, as well as patient DOB and phone number.By checking the ""Repeat Appointments"" checkbox, you can configure a repeating appointment to repeat (and end) at an interval of your choosing, from Days, Weeks, Months, or Years. Once you're happy with how your repeating appointment is configured, you can click the ""Create Repeats"" button.For example, if you plan on having a patient come in every two months starting in July for the remainder of this year, you would enter fields as so, then click the Create Repeats button. The resulting screen would appear as so:The Repeated Appointments table at the bottom displays every appointment that will be generated with this configuration. If this is acceptable, click the ""Save"" button in the lower right of the Appointment sheet to save the generated appointments to the schedule.Changes to TransparenciesTransparencies used to be split between the Schedule and the Drawer in terms of accessibility. When we evaluated Transparencies in terms of how it functioned in the old Drawer, we realized there were some opportunities to re-organize Transparencies to be a bit more intuitive.Here is a link to a video demonstrating the differences. Prior to MacPractice 11, Transparency Types were located under the ""Transparency"" node in the Schedule, while editing an individual Transparency block would use the Transparencies tab in the drawer with the transparency block scheduled. This certainly worked, but there was frequent confusion reported from our Support calls regarding the Transparency node. Many users would assume that the Transparency node would contain Transparency blocks and would create several transparency types in error.To remedy some of these problems, we've created a Transparency Types reference node in the Schedule sidebar.",484

They can be very useful for maintenance tasks or when you need to make changes to many accounts to improve your office's workflow.This article will cover some of the most common database utilities used by our offices, and how to utilize them properly.If you are looking for a more complete list of all Database Utilities, please click here.Warning: Before running any Database Utility, you should always ensure the following:You should always make sure you have a current backup. A Backup is NECESSARY before performing database utilities.You should make sure that no one is currently logged into MacPractice.1 Move Patient to Another Account2 Moving A Patient To Their Own Account3 Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing Account3.1 Things to Know4 Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$5 Remove Insurance Portion6 Revert Write-Off To Open Balance7 Update Account Provider8 Update Account Statement Status9 Update Fee Schedule10 Update Patient Fee Schedule11 Update Patient Insurance12 Update Patient Provider13 Update Procedure Type By CodeMove Patient to Another AccountThe ""Move Patient To Another Account"" Utility is used to move a Patient from one Account to either another pre-existing Account, or to move a Patient to a brand new Account. This Utility is great for situations like when a child on one Account has come of age and wants to be on their own Account so the parents aren't paying their medical bills anymore, or in cases where a family splits up but continues to see the practice separately.This Utility cannot be used to merge duplicate patient records together.",418
375,"Unfortunately in those situations you'll need to re-enter the missing information into the appropriate Account, and then archive or delete the invalid Account.Note: Before using the ""Move Patient to Another Account"" Database Utility, a patient needs to have...The Relationship to Primary set to anything BUT ""Self"" in the Patients Ability > Patient Tab.You only can move a patient if they are not the Primary Guarantor of the account.All unapplied balances connected to the account the patient is being moved from should be addressed before running this Utility. Moving A Patient To Their Own AccountGo to the Managers ability and select Database Utilities in the sidebar. In the Database Utilities menu, select select Move Patient To Another Account. You'll be presented with the following fields: Open  The first row is the Account and Patient number, Last Name, and First Name of the Patient who is moving.We strongly advise clicking the Magnifying Glass icon to search for and select the specific Patient. The second row is the Destination Account number, Destination Last Name, and Destination First Name. In this scenario, you'll leave the 2nd row blank as shown in the image, as this indicates that you wish to move the Patient to a new Account. Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window. You'll be reminded to ensure all users are logged out of MacPractice at this time. Click ""OK"" when you have confirmed this is true. Open  You'll then be taken to a prompt to automatically save a Backup. If you have already confirmed you have a fresh backup available as indicated in the beginning in the article, you can cancel this prompt. Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's new account will display with the new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Moving A Patient To A Pre-Existing AccountMoving a Patient To Another Account works exactly the same way as Moving a Patient to their Own Account. The only difference is instead of leaving the 2nd row blank, you'll select a Destination Account instead, as shown in the below screenshot.  Once satisfied, click the ""Go"" button in the lower right corner of the MacPractice window.",501

Otherwise, we still strongly recommend creating a backup before running any Database Utility. The next prompt will confirm that you wish to run the DB Utility. Click Continue when ready. After the patient has been moved, the patient's destination account will display with their new account number. Make sure you double check their demographics and insurance information and make any necessary adjustments. Things to KnowYou may move patients who have financial histories and even remaining balances to their own or to other accounts. However, a couple of specific items cannot be left unresolved on the ledger or it may prevent the patient from being moved.Make sure all payments are applied to the account before moving the patient. Unapplied payments will display in red. Unpaid financial charges apply to the entire account and will prevent the account from moving. Either apply a payment for that finance charge, or enter a negative adjustment to zero it out before moving the patient. If the finance charge should still apply, you may choose to go back into the original account and remove the negative adjustment. If the patient is the primary of the account and the patient-primary relationship is set to ""Self"" you will not be allowed to move the record.You may choose to move one of the patients from this primary account to another. Or if the rest of the family account needs to remain together, you could temporarily change the patient relationship status to another option, move the account, and then verify or correct the relationship indicator on  both account's patient records.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %/$The Raise/Lower Fee Schedule Database Utilities are used to make wide adjustments to a fee schedule. There are actually two utilities that perform this function.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by %: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a percentage amount. For example, you can choose to lower all fees by 4.5%. This utility also contains options to control how the utility handles rounding.",466
377,"The image above reflects this utility.Raise/Lower Fee Schedule by $: This utility allows you to raise or lower all fees in a selected fee schedule by a given dollar amount. For example, you can choose to raise all fees by a flat $50 rate.As an precaution, you may want to make a duplicate of the fee schedule you intend to run this utility for. You can do this by navigating to the References Ability, selecting the Fee Schedule node, then selecting the Fee Schedule in question. From the Menu, select Edit > Duplicate Fee Schedule.For either Utility, you'll first set whether you want to Raise or Lower, then select the Fee Schedule you wish to adjust.If you're using the percentage utility, you'll need to indicate the percentage amount you want to raise or lower by in the Raise By/Lower By field. Then, select the rounding option. You can choose to round to the nearest dollar amount, whether to round UP to the nearest dollar amount, or not to round at all.For example, if a $100 dollar fee was increased by 4.1%, you'd be left with 104.10.Do Not Round would leave this amount as is.Round to the nearest dollar would round this value DOWN to 104.00.Round up to the nearest dollar would round this value UP to 105.00.If you're using the dollar amount utility, all you need to do is indicate the dollar amount which you want to raise or lower your fees in the Fee Schedule by.Remove Insurance PortionThe Remove Insurance Portion Database Utility allows the user to remove unexpected insurance portions from patients' ledgers. You can choose to run this for a specific account, or for all patients within your database.First, you'll select whether you want to impact all patients in the database, or a specific account. If you select ""For Account"", a field will appear allowing you to enter an account number.Next, you'll set whether you want the utility to hide charges with accurate portions, or charges that aren't on outstanding claims. These are checkboxes; you can either have one, both, or none checked.By clicking ""Show Charges with Insurance Portions"", the Charge Table will populate with all charges with insurance portions. By scrolling right, you can see the status of the Primary and Secondary Insurance, if applicable. You'll also be able to see the Insurance Portion currently on the shown charges.From here, you can simply check and uncheck charges you wish to remove the insurance portion of.",499
378,"Once you're satisfied, clicking Go will run the database utility for those checked charges. Revert Write-Off To Open BalanceThis database utility relates directly to write-off changes made in MacPractice 10.7. Please click here for a detailed article on those write-off changes and how to use the Revert Write-Off To Open Balance utility.Update Account ProviderThe Update Account Provider Database Utility is used to adjust the Account Provider (located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability) from one Provider to another Provider for all patient accounts in the database.First, you'll select the Provider you want to change all your patient accounts FROM in the ""Current Provider"" field.Then, you'll select the Provider you want to change all of your patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Provider"" field.Finally, if you want to adjust the Account Office for all patient accounts, you'll want to check the ""Also Update Office"" checkbox and use the ""Update Office To"" pop up to select the desired office.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Account Statement StatusThis utility updates the ""Where To Send Statements"" and the ""Monthly Statement Options"" fields, located in the Account Tab of the Patient Ability, for all patients in your database. This is often used to standardize how statements are sent for your patients.First, you'll select the Statement Status which you wish to transition patient accounts FROM using the ""Current Statement Status"" field.Then you'll select the Statement Status you want to transition patient accounts TO in the ""Update to Status"" field.Finally, you can choose whether you also wish to update the ""Send Statement To"" field for all impacted patient accounts.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the database utility.Update Fee ScheduleThe Update Fee Schedule Database Utility is used to update several characteristics of the codes within a Fee Schedule. The Utility will update either all of your Fee Schedules or a specific Fee Schedule, and you can also hone down and change characteristics for a defined range of charge codes.First, you'll define which Fee Schedule you wish to update in the ""Update Fees in Fee Schedule"" pop-up menu. If you want to update all of your Fee Schedules, you can select the ""All Fee Schedules"" option.",456
379,"Then, if there is a specific range of codes you would like to update, set that range in the ""Code Start"" and ""Code End"" fields.Next, you'll use the checkboxes on the left side to choose which characteristics to update, and then use the corresponding pop up menus to choose what to update that characteristic TO. For example, if I wanted to update all fee schedule codes to have Dr. Awesome set as the default provider, I'd check the Default Provider checkbox, then select ""Bob Awesome"" in the Default Provider pop-up.With this utility, you can update:Default ProviderDefault OfficePlace of ServiceType of ServiceDefault RecallProcedure TypeProcedure CategorySet ""Require Co-Pay""Set ""Require Lab""When satisfied, click the Go button to run the Database Utility.Update Patient Fee ScheduleThis particular utility is used to update the Default Fee Schedule, selected in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability, for all patients with a given Fee Schedule selected.First, you need to select what Fee Schedule you want to change FROM by selecting the Fee Schedule in the ""Update All Patients with Fee Schedule"" field.Then, you need to select the Fee Schedule you want to switch these patients TO in the ""To Fee Schedule"" field.Once you're satisfied, click the Go button to run this utility. All patients with the first selected Fee Schedule will then have the second Fee Schedule selected.Update Patient InsuranceThis database utility is used to adjust patients with one insurance carrier and plan to a different insurance carrier and plan.First, you'll select the carrier which you want to change patients FROM in the ""Current Carrier"" field. If there's a specific plan that you want to transition patients from, you can define that in the corresponding ""Plan Name"" field.Then, you can select the carrier which you want to change patients TO in the ""Update to Carrier"" field, along with any specific plan to transition patients to if desired.Finally, if you want to define the start/end dates for each patient, you can do so by checking the ""Update New Insurance's Start Date and Old Insurance's End Date As"" checkbox and then using the date field to define a specific date. This will serve as the new insurance's Start Date and the old insurance's End Date.When satisfied, click the Go button to run the utility.Update Patient ProviderThis Utility is used to update the default Provider for all patients from one provider to another provider. This Provider field is located in the Patient Tab of the Patients Ability.",496

Open Incident SidebarFirst, let's address the Incident Sidebar, which contains sections for the Patient Chart, Treatment Plans, Perio Chart, and then within Incidents (the blue folders) there are sections for Completed Procedures and Treatment Plan. We will be focusing on the              Patient Chart, and within the Incident Folder we will focus on Completed Procedures and the Treatment Plan.The Patient Chart allows us to chart pre-existing work that may have not been administered by your office. Procedures added to this chart will not be charged in the Ledger. By default, these procedures are outlined in Blue by default on the chart.Completed Procedures are work that has been completed by your office. These procedures will be added to a patient's ledger, and are outlined in Green by default on the chart. It is important to stress that any procedures added to Completed Procedures will count towards the patient's balance.A Treatment Plan indicates planned work that has not been completed yet and is planned for the future. These procedures are added to a patient's Treatment Plan which can be moved to Completed at any time. These procedures are outlined in Red by default on the chart. To the right is an example of a procedure charted on the Patient Chart, Completed Procedures, and a Treatment Plan, in that order from left to right.",459
395,"The outline color differentiates what kind of procedure it is.Note: If you have Hide Material Colors checked in Highlighting Options (the Gear icon in the upper right of the Restorative Charting window), the 'material color' (the green in the above screenshot) will be replaced with the outline color. This may be more useful for you. See How to Set Up Restorative Charting - Hide Material Colors for more detail.Charting ProceduresTo chart a procedure on a tooth, first select either the Patient Chart, Completed Procedures, or Treatment plan, then simply right click the tooth in question. This will bring up the Charting Menu. From there, you can choose the type of procedure you wish to chart. Click OK when you are satisfied with your choice, and the procedure will be added to the chart.Alternatively, if you have a Charting Shortcut you'd like to use, simply click on the tooth you wish to apply a procedure to, and then click on the appropriate Charting Shortcut. For more information on how to set up Charting Shortcuts, please refer to How to Set Up Restorative Charting - Charting Shortcuts.If you wish to chart an item without a tooth selected for the purposes of exams and other procedure codes that aren't tied to a specific tooth, you can click on the ""Chart Without Tooth"" option. This will pull up the Charting Menu.Charting Menu SelectionsYou can find a list of all of the Charting Menu Selections in this article here. Each category can have procedure codes tied to the category by accessing the Charting Code Map on the MacPractice Server computer. Chart HistoryThe Chart History control allows you to cycle through each visit/procedure date to review the progression of a patient's chart over time.The Dental Timeline is assembled by each treatment's procedure date present on the Chart. You can use the ""Chart History"" drop down to choose a date you wish to review, or you can cycle through the dates by using the arrow buttons.It is important to note that newly charted procedures will default to a procedure date of the New Patient Date field, located in the Patient Tab.Clinical Notes TableThe Clinical Note Table is where you can find a textual view for each procedure charted on a selected tooth.",460
396,"Consider the Clinical Notes Table a complement to the graphical view of the Restorative Chart view.If no tooth is selected, the Clinical Notes Table will include every procedure on a patient's chart, as long as the filters above the Clinical Notes Table are enabled. If a tooth is selected, the Clinical Notes Table will only display the procedures listed on that particular tooth.You can also use the colored tabs to filter out particular procedures. By default, all filters are active, so all procedures will be included in the table. If you wanted to filter out a set of procedures (for example, all Pre-Existing procedures), you would simply click the tab in question that you wish to filter out.Adding Clinical NotesTo add a Clinical Note to a procedure, simply click on the Clinical Note field and press the tab button. This will bring the selector inside the Note field, and you can type out your note.To add a Clinical Note without a procedure, you can either right click a tooth and select 'Note', or you can click the Plus icon in the upper right of the Clinical Note table (visible in the above gif to the right of the Search bar).Once a Clinical Note has been added, you can lock it from any changes by clicking on the lock icon in the Clinical Note Table. If a Clinical Note is unlocked, you can also change it by clicking the Clinical Note field and pressing tab. Only the user who locked the note can unlock it.If you double click the field, a window will appear displaying each change that had been made to this Clinical Note, and allow you to make in depth changes.If you have a Common Clinical Note set in References > Common Clinical Notes, you can simply type the first few letters of the name or the text within a Common Clinical Note and it will automatically populate in a list.If you delete a Procedure that had a Clinical Note tied to the Procedure, the Clinical Note will be placed in a separate filter named ""Deleted Notes"" to the right of ""Conditions"".",401

It's a powerful tool to save you time and energy when addressing any note letter needs.This article will provide an overview of the functionality of the Notes Ability. We'll cover generating patient notes, building a note template, and show how you can set up your note templates to pull information already entered into areas of MacPractice so each note is automatically custom tailored for each patient.1 Setting Up Notes Preferences2 Creating Patient Notes2.1 Creating a blank Patient Note2.2 Creating a Note from a Template3 Managing and Editing Patient Notes3.1 Editing Patient Notes3.2 Categories and Parts3.3 Locking Patient Notes3.4 Archiving and Unarchiving Notes4 Creating and Managing Templates4.1 Creating a Blank Template4.2 Shared Templates4.3 Uploading Templates4.4 Note Template Groups4.5 Notes Images and Image Pull FieldsSetting Up Notes PreferencesOpen Before working in the Notes Ability for the first time, it's always a good idea to check and configure the Notes Preferences. Navigate to the MacPractice Menu and select Preferences. Then, search for and click on ""Notes"" in the Preferences Window sidebar.Open From here, you can adjust several different Preferences that impact the Notes Ability. We recommend you adjust the ""Format Date As"" field to fit your needs, and confirm that the print margins are correct.

This method is typically used to create several patient notes at once.Drag the patient name or appointment from the sidebar to the Note Template in the sidebar of the Patients or Schedule ability. This method is useful for generating a quick note when working out of the Schedule or Patients ability.If the Appointment pull fields (not the Appointment Table pull fields) are present in a template, the note must be created by dragging the appointment to the note template in the sidebar of the Scheduling ability. Otherwise, MacPractice will not be able to determine which appointment's information should be pulled into the note.Managing and Editing Patient NotesIn this section we'll review all of the tools available to manage and lock down your Patient Notes.Editing Patient NotesThe Note Editor functions as a basic word processor.From left to right:Styles Drop Down Menu: This drop down allows you to set bolding, italics, outlining, etc. on any text entry.Justify Buttons: The Justify buttons allow you to set text to be justified on the left side, right side, or middle of the page.Spacing Drop Down: This drop down menu allows you to determine the spacing between lines. This is set to single by default.Lists Drop Down: Lists allow you to add bullet points to a list, or a numbered order to a list. Fonts Drop Down: This drop down allows you to choose your desired font.Color Selector: The color selector, when clicked, allows you to select any color for your text.Image Selector: The image icon, when clicked, allows you to insert an image into the current Patient Note. It is important to note that the Images/Attachments Ability is more suited towards storing images associated to a patient.",460
404,"You can learn how to use the Images/Attachments Ability here.Categories and PartsCategories are groupings of similar Parts, which are pre-built sections of text that can be dragged and dropped into a Patient Note. These are useful if you have a few sections of text for situations that you plan on re-using. For example, the below screenshot has the ""Cold"" Part in the ""Subjective"" category. The contents of the Part are in the Note Editor. To create a new Category, you can select the Categories Node in the Sidebar, then click the Green Plus. A new Category header will be created where you can name the Category.With a Category selected in the Sidebar, the Green Plus and Red Minus will appear next to the Category as shown in the above screenshot. This allows you to add and delete Parts. With a Part selected, you can then use the Note Editor to create that part.To move a Part into a Patient Note, with a Note selected simply drag and drop the desired Part to the Note.Locking Patient NotesLocking a Patient Note will prevent any future changes from occurring on the Note. A note that has been locked cannot be unlocked, so it's important to ensure the note is exactly how you want it before you lock it. Locking a note can be important to ensure that a patient's history is retained, and it's helpful to lock down correspondence sent for auditing purposes later.To lock a note, simply drag the note in the Sidebar into the ""Locked"" node. (The Locked checkbox is for usage with Templates instead of Patient Notes).Archiving and Unarchiving NotesArchiving a note will remove it from the sidebar as if you had deleted the item, but it can be retrievable should you change your mind later or need to refer to the note. To archive a note, simply select the note in the Sidebar, then click the Red Minus button at the top of the sidebar. Alternatively, you can select the note and press the Delete key on your keyboard.",417
405,"A confirmation prompt will appear.To unarchive a Note, you can navigate to the File Menu > Retrieve Archived > Notes.A window will appear with all archived notes, which you can unarchive as you wish.Creating and Managing TemplatesThis section will cover how to set up Templates and get the most out of them to make creating Patient-specific notes as quick and easy as possible.Creating a Blank TemplateCreating a template is as simple as creating a Patient Note. Select the Templates node, then click the Green Plus above the Sidebar. The template's initial contents (pull fields, text, and margins) are pulled from the Default Template record.With a new template, you can begin to enter text, and drag and drop in elements from the pull field palette in the lower left that will pull in information for that patient automatically. When writing a Template, you want to write it in such a way that it can be used for multiple purposes. Here is an example for a new patient note template:All pull field elements in the above example are noted by <<>>'s, indicating that this information will be populated with the correct patient's data, as well as the office's data. If the office's demographics were to change, this note template would update accordingly due to the usage of the office pull fields.When a Template is saved, it will have the Locked checkbox checked. This will prevent changes unless you intentionally uncheck the Locked checkbox.Please refer to our Knowledge Base article on Template Basics for more information on how to create and edit Templates. For more information on Pull Fields, please refer to Notes - Pull Field Basics. Finally, don't forget that if you ever have any questions or you're having trouble achieving a specific result, don't hesitate to contact MacPractice Support!Shared TemplatesWithin the Shared Template Node in the Notes Ability, MacPractice contains a library of templates created by other MacPractice users that can be downloaded and added to your office's database. These Shared Templates can then be customized to meet your specific needs.To peruse the available Templates, select the Specialties you'd like to peruse, then click the Apply button within the Shared Templates node. This will populate the list of available Templates for the selected Specialties.",449
406,"From there, you can select a Template and click the Download button to download the Template.Downloaded Templates are stored in the Downloads node.Uploading TemplatesOne convenient feature with Shared Templates is that you can upload your created templates to the Shared Template library, which will allow you to download those templates on different clients.To upload a note template, you'll first want to save a copy on your disk drive. First, with the Template you wish to upload selected, navigate to the Notes menu and select ""Export Template...""The Save window will open. Name the file and save the location to a convenient location you can refer to easily, then click Save.With that template file created and saved, navigate to the Notes menu again and select ""Upload Notes Template to Server..."" listed below ""Export Template..."" You will be prompted to select a file. Locate the Template you just created and saved, select it and click Open. You'll receive an alert that will either indicate that the upload was successful, or that the note has already been uploaded. Once complete, you can then download that note from any other client.If you encounter any issues uploading Templates, please contact MacPractice Support.Note Template GroupsNote Template Groups provide a tool to keep your Note Templates organized for easy access in the future. They essentially function as Template folders.To create a new Note Template Group, select the Note Template Group node, then click the Green Plus in the sidebar. From there, you can name and determine where in order the Note Template Group should be displayed in the sidebar.The first two nodes will always be Templates and Downloads (0 and 1, respectively).Once created, a node similar to Templates and Downloads will be present, with your chosen name on the label.Notes Images and Image Pull FieldsIncorporating Images into Notes and Templates is a relatively easy task.First, you can add an Image directly into any Note by either using the Image Selector when editing a Note, or dragging and dropping an image into the Note.Second, if you plan on using a particular image frequently, such as your practice's logo, you can add them to the Notes Images node by selecting the Notes Images node. Click the green plus button in the upper left hand corner.A Tag is needed to reference this Notes Image in your Templates. Enter a Tag that you can easily enter, and click Import to select the image.",480

This article covers how to configure Perio-specific settings and how to best utilize Perio Charting.Before continuing onwards, if you have not configured Restorative Charting, you will likely want to do so to ensure your tooth numbers are all configured appropriately for your office. You can review our set up guide located here.And as always, MacPractice Support is standing by to assist you if you would like some help!Note: New in 10.7 and 11.3, the ""Attached Gingiva"" notation point can now be noted by a range of 0 to 5, instead of the previous method of notation. You can toggle this method by checking your Notation Options. For any questions regarding this change, please contact MacPractice Support.1 Setting Up Perio1.1 Perio Charting Options1.2 Notation Points Options1.3 Using Perio1.4 Comparing Perio Records1.5 Printing Perio ChartsSetting Up PerioMuch like Restorative Charting, in order to best use Perio, it's helpful to spend some time configuring everything to meet the needs of your office and how you approach Perio Charting. Thankfully, MacPractice has some great customization options available.Note: MacPractice is compatible with Dental R.A.T. devices. Please contact Dental R.A.T. for more information.First you will need to access a Perio Chart. Pull up a patient and create a new Perio Record by navigating to the Patients Ability > Dental tab, and then click ""Perio Chart"" in the sidebar.Open IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that the settings we are about to adjust are user-based. Meaning, if you log into a different User in MacPractice, these settings may not carry over.",477
412,"Be sure that each user intending to use Perio Charting takes a moment to configure these settings!There are two areas where you can configure how the Perio Charting will work; Perio Charting Options, and Notation Points Options.Open Perio Charting OptionsTo access Perio Charting Options, click on the gear icon as highlighted and annotated in the screenshot above.The most important function in the Perio Charting Options is the ability to re-organize the input order. Here, you can drag and drop the blocks of tooth numbers to match the order in which your office would like to chart Perio.      To do this, simply left click and drag the row to the order you desire.US Tooth Number ChartInternational Tooth Number ChartFor assistance, please contact MacPractice Support.You can also set the threshold that determines whether a perio entry is highlighted due to a higher value set. By default, this is set to 5. So for example, if you enter a Gingival Margin Probing of 6 on a perio entry box, that box will highlight in red. But entries of 5 and below will not be highlighted.Notation Points OptionsIn Notation Points Options, you can customize which notations points are utilized in the Perio Chart. Simply check and uncheck to add and remove notation points as you wish. You can also click the question mark icon to the right of each category for information on how to enter data for each point.You can also drag and drop these categories in any order you choose, like in Perio Charting Options. This will impact the order in which these notation points are displayed in the Perio Chart.Using PerioWhen first charting Perio for a patient, you will likely want to create a new Perio Record. Simply click on ""Perio Chart"" in the Incident sidebar for the options to create a new Perio Record. You can choose to create a blank Perio Record, or you can pull all or some information from prior Perio Charts by using the ""New Perio Record From Most Recent"". You can choose to either pull everything, or pick which notation points to pull.Once you've chosen this option, you will be presented with the Perio Chart.",461
413,"We'll use a blank one for our example purposes here.When you first create a Perio Record, it'll take you to the first notation point on the first tooth and pocket that you have organized in Perio Charting Options and Notation Points Options. In the above screenshot, you can see the blue highlighter indicating which Notation Point we are currently charting.From here, you can begin to enter data into each pocket as each notation point accepts it. Each Notation Point accepts a slightly different set of data which you can review in Perio - Notation Points.The Perio Chart displays gingival margin, probing depth visually on each tooth. by a wide bar and a narrow bar, respectively. The entire length of both bars represents Clinical Attachment Loss, which is calculated by adding Gingival Margin and Probing Depth.Furcation is also visually represented on a chart in the form of black triangles.The color is representative of the depths. Deeper probing depths and gingival margin values will be red, with shallower probing depths and margin values showing up green. Restorations from the Restorative Charting Ability may also display, depending on the Perio Charting Settings.You can also select the Incident, Provider and Hygienist for the Perio Record using the drop down menus at the top. You may also rename the Visit Name and set the Visit date.In the upper right of the Perio Chart there is a zoom slider that will allow you to customize how zoomed in the Perio Chart view is. Increasing the zoom will improve readability of the chart, but you won't be able to see the entire chart at a glance. You should adjust the zoom to your personal preference.For notation points that accept values higher than 10, hold the Option key and type the number desired., i.e for 11, hold Option and type 11.You can also use the Data Entry panel to enter data into any Notation Point as well by using the mouse.You can jump to any notation point on the currently selected tooth by using the Keyboard Shortcut.

We refer to this section as the Clinical Summary.To the left, you'll see the Clinical Sidebar, which allows you to select a patient to review, and provides access to any References that apply to Clinical Widgets.By default, the Summary will display clinical information from all available Incidents to give you a comprehensive look at a patient's record.If you want to narrow down to a specific Incident, you can use the Filter Incidents header in the upper left to select specific Incidents, or narrow down the results to a specific time range.You can quickly navigate to the Clinical Ability by setting a keyboard shortcut. You can do this by navigating to the Menu Commands Reference in the References Ability and setting up the keyboard shortcut there. The Clinical Shortcut is located in the View Menu.If you need to export a single Clinical Summary for a given patient, you can utilize the ""Export Incident"" drop down. If you need to export multiple CCDAs for all of your patients, the CCDA Export Manager can assist you with this. If you are set up with a Health Information Exchange, the HIE Manager section will detail how to export and download data from your HIE.Clinical PreferencesThere are a few Preferences that relate to the Clinical Ability.",460
417,"You can access these by navigating to the MacPractice Menu and selecting Preferences, then selecting ""Clinical"" in the sidebar of the Preferences window.Open The ""Default CCDA Sections"" tab allows you to choose precisely what Clinical sections/widgets are included by default when generating a CCDA record. CCDA records are essentially the patient's chart information which is uploaded to the Patient Portal.It is important to note that you have an opportunity to adjust per patient when exporting CCDAs to the Patient Portal. The options set here are not set in stone, they are merely defaults.The Other Tab contains one Preference, ""Use Current Date for a New Diagnosis"". This applies to the Problem List's Onset Date field, and when checked, the current date will be used for the Onset Date by default when adding a new Diagnosis to the Problem List.Finally, if you would like to set the Clinical Ability as the default Ability when you start up MacPractice, you can select ""Window"" in the Preferences Sidebar. From here, you can click the pop-up menu for ""Default Ability"" and select ""Clinical"".The Clinical SidebarThe Clinical Sidebar has a few tools to better facilitate the functionality of the Clinical Ability. The Patients node mimics the functionality of the Patients node in the Patients Ability, in that you can utilize it to select patients.The Clinical Sidebar also contains the CCDA Export Manager, a tool that can assist with bulk-exporting any patient charts that have been changed/saved in the last 48 hours.  If run regularly, this will ensure that the Clinical Summary records are uploaded regularly to your Patient Portal if you have the Patient Portal purchased on your license.Finally, the References section contains References that apply to some of the Clinical Ability widgets. These formerly belonged in the References Ability, but we opted to consolidate these in the Clinical Ability.Let's cover each one in turn:Clinical ReferencesThe References section in the sidebar contains Reference Nodes that relate directly to the widgets contained in the Clinical Summary. You can read more about Widgets in the Widgets section.There are five Reference categories that you can manage. You can use the Green Plus and Red Minus in the sidebar to add and remove entries as needed.Immunization: This Reference node ties directly to the Immunizations widget.",455
418,"It allows you to define the immunizations that your practice conducts.Immunization records are codified; you cannot create custom immunizations.Info Button Resources: The Info Button Resources Reference contains links to websites that utilize the InfoButton standard to pull contextual information for particular clinical widgets that have an Info Button.For example, when a user clicks the Info Button by the Allergies widget, a window will populate that will pull information regarding this patient's allergies. The source of said information will be the Info Button Resources references entered here in this node.Only links that use the InfoButton standard can be used to pull information.Patient Education Resources: This reference node allows you to add and manage any Patient Education Resources. The resources added here will be able to be added to a patient's clinical summary under the  Patient Education Resources widget.Preventive Routine Cares: This reference contains any Preventive Routine Cares for use in the Preventive Care widget. That widget is used to track Preventive Care that has been conducted by another practice, typically via referrals.Smoking Status: This reference allows you to define the options you can select in the Smoking Status widget. CCDA Export ManagerThe CCDA Export Manager is a specialized tool that assists with bulk exporting Clinical Summaries in order to aid with complying with MIPS requirements for the View, Download, Transmit report. The CCDA Export Manager is only visible if your MacPractice license has MIPS added to it.At the time of this writing, the CCDA Export Manager is designed to detect any patients that meet this criteria:An Office Visit code is present in a charge on the patient's ledger (Typically 99201-99205).The patient's chart has seen a change in the last 48 hours to the patient's demographics, ledger or a Clinical Ability widget.The patient's CCDA record has not already been uploaded to the Patient Portal.If these criteria are met, the patient account will populate in the Export Manager.From the CCDA Export Manager node, you can see all patient accounts that have had the Office Visit procedure code added to the ledger in the last 48 hours that need to be exported.You can adjust what Clinical sections are included on their CCDA export by clicking the ""Included Sections"" buttons.",451
419,"You can define what CCDA Sections are included by default in Clinical Preferences.The Map Codes button in the Needs Mapping column allows you to map any codes that require mapping to the proper codes.When you are ready, you can either check each patient account you wish to export in the Export column, or use the ""Check All"" checkbox to select all patient accounts. When they are selected, click the ""Export Selected"" button in the lower right. This will export the CCDA records and clear the Export Manager.HIE ManagerThe HIE Manager is used to upload and receive patient information to a Health Information Exchange (HIE). The HIE Manager is only visible if your MacPractice license has MIPS added to it. You'll also need to have a HIE URL tied to your MacPractice License. In order to do this, you'll need to contact MacPractice Support. You'll need to provide the desired HIE's URL in order for our Support Representatives to link the HIE URL to your MacPractice license.The HIE Manager has two functions available when you expand the HIE Manager node in the Clinical Sidebar:  Export/Request Data, and HIE Data History. Let's cover each of them in turn.Export/Request Data:The Export/Request Data node is used to both export data to and download data from an HIE. The top half of the Export/Request Data node displays options to filter the search results much like our MacPractice Reports. You can set a start and end date to filter patient incidents that need exporting. Leaving the date fields blank will pull from all patients. The drop down menu allows you to select the type of date you're filtering. Your options are:Patients with Dates of Service Between: This option will include incidents that have procedures with dates of service between the date range.Patients with Appointments Between: This option will include the most recent incident for the patient that falls within the date range.Clicking Apply will generate results in the table, identifying patient Incidents that are in need of exporting to your HIE.",415

This button will only appear if the incident in question has unmapped procedure codes. When clicked, the code mapper window will open where you can resolve your unmapped procedure codes.Most Recent Appointment: This column will display the most recent appointment for the patient.When you've finished reviewing and you've checked the Export and Request Data checkboxes for the patients you wish to transmit data for, you can click the Export and Request Data button to begin transmitting data. On success, you'll be prompted with a message indicating how many records were transmitted successfully.HIE Data HistoryThe Data History node tracks all exported or downloaded data for record keeping. Here, you can identify when data was downloaded or exported, and you can use it to identify which documents have been downloaded without having to hunt for specific patients.The HIE Data is organized into batches. When you click the Export and Request Data button in the Export/Request Data node, data is exported and downloaded in a single batch.",384
421,"Batches appear in the upper table of the Data History view, and can be filtered by batch date if you're looking for a specific date of exports/requests.The upper table's information is split into multiple columns:Created: This indicates the date when the batch was generated.User: The MacPractice user that initiated the batch (In other words, the user that clicked the Export & Request Data button.# of Exports: The total number of CCDA records that were generated and uploaded to the HIE.# of Requests: The total number of patient files that have been sent from the HIE to your MacPractice Server. This is NOT the same as the number of patients with data sent, as an individual patient may have multiple files downloaded. # of Patients with Downloads: The total number of patients that had documents downloaded from the HIE.If you don't see a particular column, you may need to scroll left or right in the upper table.The lower table is populated by selecting a particular batch from the upper table, and will show the individual exports and requests that were contained in that batch. You can toggle between viewing exports and requests by clicking on the ""Exported Data"" and ""Requested Data"" tabs.The columns in this second table are:Patient NameIncident NameIncident DateAt the bottom of the Data History view, you can use the Open File(s) button to open and view any data that was requested and received in the Requested Data tab. You can also click the ""Go To Patient Clinical"" button to be taken to that patient's chart in the Clinical Ability.Customizing the Clinical SummaryFirst and foremost, you can adjust the zoom level of the Clinical Summary by pressing Command-Plus or Command-Minus on your keyboard. If you're having trouble reading the text, this can help you make the text size larger.One of the features in the Clinical Summary is the ability to organize, hide, and customize the colors of each of these widgets. You can access the editing tools by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right of the Clinical Tab.All of these settings will be remembered on a per user basis, so your display will follow you from computer to computer based on your MacPractice user.In this window, you can drag and drop items into any order you wish, and the Clinical Summary will display the widgets in the order you drag them into here. Keep in mind that you can also drag them from the left side to the right, and vice versa.",497
422,"If you don't plan on using a particular widget, you can uncheck it to prevent it from displaying on the Summary.You can also customize the display color of a widget by clicking on the color bar to the right of the widget name. This will bring up the color picker tool where you can choose whatever color you desire, if the default colors are not to your liking.Exporting a Single Clinical SummaryEarlier in this article, we described the method to bulk export Clinical Summaries to the Patient Portal in the CCDA Export Manager section. However, sometimes you'll simply need to export a single patient's Clinical Summary.First, select your Patient in question. At the very top of the Clinical Ability, you can see the ""Export Incident..."" drop down. This is greyed out until you select an Incident in the ""Incident"" drop down menu. If you have multiple Incidents, please refer to the Ledger Tab of the Patients Ability to review your Incidents.There are three options available in the Export Incident drop down:To Patient: This option will export the patient's Clinical Summary for the selected Incident to the Patient Portal. You can also opt to print off the Clinical Summary for the patient's records, as shown in the screenshot below.In this window, you can also opt to not include any information segments by unchecking them in the sidebar.Associate with existing ""Transition To"": This option will associate the given Clinical Summary to an existing Referral that has their Referral Category set to ""Transition To."" This option is used when you want to refer the patient to a provider outside of your practice. You can find a patient's existing Referrals in the Patients Ability, under the Patient Tab > Referrals sub-tab. You'll be first prompted to select a Referral, and then you can opt to either Print the summary, or you can transmit it to a valid Direct Address.Create new ""Transition To"": This option will allow you to create a new Transition To referral for the patient and then assign the exported CCDA to that referral. Otherwise it behaves much like the ""Associate to existing"" option.WidgetsWidgets are the individual blocks that make up the Clinical Summary. By default, the widgets are in a ""dropped down"" state, meaning that their contents are expanded much like nodes in the sidebar. You can click the triangle on the left of the widget name to shrink this widget until you need it.Each widget behaves a little differently depending on the purpose behind it.",499

The Accounting Migration Report - MacPractice HelpDesk - Confluence SpacesAppsTemplatesCreateMacPractice HelpDeskAll contentCalendarsSpace settingsContentMacPractice HelpDeskInstallation, Updates, Login & BackupsThe Accounting Migration ReportShareThe Accounting Migration ReportDylan NighOwned by Dylan NighLast updated: Nov 16, 2023Loading data...One of the key features of MacPractice Build 10 is the Accounting Ability, a new way to monitor and review your Accounts Receivable and Ledger data. We're very excited to present this new feature (and several more!) to you, but in order to incorporate this feature we had to make some structural changes to how ledger information is stored and accounted for in the software.Our goal is to ensure that your data's integrity is assured when updating, despite these structural changes. In order to meet this goal, we need every office on MacPractice Build 7.3 that intends on updating beyond Build 7.3 to run the Accounting Migration Report.Running The Accounting Migration ReportFirst, you'll need to be on the Server Computer.You'll want to make sure that you have a fresh backup available.You'll need to set aside plenty of time. This report simulates the process of updating to a new build of MacPractice, and so will take the same amount of time as a large update. We recommend running it overnight.Finally, you'll need to ensure that all users are logged out of MacPractice.This Report is located in the Managers Ability, under the Database Utilities node. It is called ""Run Accounting Migration Report"".  Open  Once you've located the report, all you'll need to do is click the Go button in the lower right. You will be asked to log out of any terminal or client computers. Next the utility will ask you to save a backup. You may choose to skip this by choosing ""Cancel"" or run a fresh backup by choosing ""Save Backup"" after selecting the location you would like to write the backup to. Lastly, you will then be prompted to authenticate. All you'll need there is the OS Username and Password for the Server Computer. Once you have authenticated, the migration report will begin.",446

Categories and Parts - MacPractice HelpDesk - Confluence SpacesAppsTemplatesCreateMacPractice HelpDeskAll contentCalendarsSpace settingsContentMacPractice HelpDeskNotes and Paper FormsCategories and PartsCategories and PartsDylan NighOwned by Dylan NighApr 27, 2023Loading data...While Templates are useful for creating an entire preset document, it may be more useful to construct a letter from several, smaller predesigned sets of text. These sets are known as Categories and Parts. Categories are groups of similar Parts, and Parts contain predefined text and pull fields.For example, when creating a pre-procedure instruction sheet for a patient, there may be Parts that contain the pre-procedure instructions for each specific procedure, and these can be organized within a Category called Pre-Procedure Instructions. Other common Categories include Headers for several letter introductions or letterheads, a Closings category that contains a number of letter endings or signatures, and so on. Parts can be utilized to create very flexible documents.Creating a CategoryCategories exist to organize Parts. To create a new Category, select the Categories node in the sidebar and click the green plus button. A New Category will be created and can be renamed to reflect the type of text it will contain.Open  Sorting CategoriesTo reorganize Categories in the upper pane of the Notes Ability, click and drag the category to the desired order.Open  Creating PartsTo create a Part within a Category, select the Category and click the small green plus button to the right of the category name. A New Part will be added to the list and can be renamed by clicking the name or pressing the Tab key.  To add text and pull fields to the Part, select it in the list and add the text to the text area in the main part of the window. In the example below, a new part containing information about the patient's last payment was created. Using PartsTo use a Part, simply drag the Part title from the Category list to the body of the note or template. {""serverDuration"": 21, ""requestCorrelationId"": ""da98c3534ed84f34a726869065bc55a5""}",464
